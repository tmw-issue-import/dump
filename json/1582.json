{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1582] Void Bolt/Void Eruption Is Not Prioritizing In a Meta When Put At The Top of the List ","body":" <p>I understand you cannot track Void Bolt due to how the spell was designed.&nbsp; I also understand Void Eruption should be tracked and a condition should be created to track Void Form.&nbsp; But when this icon is created and put at the top of the list in a meta, it does not show when it is prioritized as first in the list.&nbsp; The condition of Void Form is tracked by using Buff - Number of &gt; player &gt; Void Form &gt; `1 active.&nbsp; Initially, Void Bolt will show immediately after Void Eruption, then it will show a second time over a Mind Flay cast as it should.&nbsp; When it's supposed to show for a 3rd or 4th time it will not.&nbsp; Other spells in the priority will show instead.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daemon9\">daemon9</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1582\">#1582</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1582.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-09-20T01:16:02Z","created_at":"2018-09-20T00:53:20Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T01:16:02Z","labels":[]},"comments":[]}
