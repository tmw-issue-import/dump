The archaeology conditions were only ever added because they work exactly the same as the regular currency conditions - no extra code needed to be written to include them. In hindsight, they probably never should have been added, since TMW's area of focus is combat, and archaeology is combat not.</p>\r\n<p>2) The conditions still function - you just can't select them. So, just set it up the first time you see that fragment type on any of your characters (which might happen 2-3 times per expansion), and you will be set for life.</p>\r\n<p>3) No. It wouldn't be any more efficient - if anything, it would be less efficient. TMW conditions already compile down to pure Lua, which means that they benefit from all the things that the language provides, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation\" rel=\"nofollow\">short-circuit evaluation</a>. A single condition might actually be slightly less efficient in terms of CPU usage than many conditions.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-08-18T03:29:29Z"}]}
