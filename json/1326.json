{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1326] Fist of Fury not on \"DR-Stun\" ","body":" <p>I posted about this about 2 weeks ago, and the problem was fixed with in 24 hours on the beta file. Now the the new release is out, it is back to fist of fury not being on the DR. It now says when I hover over the \"DR-Stun\" grp that in fact fist of fury is in there, but not sure if it is wrong idea or what, cuz after hours of messing with it can not get it to work. Please please fix, at 2.2k cr in 3s and my pally is getting really pissed at me for not know when the DR is good all the time haha. thank you again for this addon, it is by farm my favorite and i have made over 100 people download it through out the years, and will continue to do so!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/leflos1\">leflos1</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1326\">#1326</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1326.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-28T02:33:04Z","created_at":"2016-10-27T18:34:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-28T02:33:04Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I mean, you can always just add it to your icon...</p>\r\n<p>\"DR-Stun; Fists of Fury\"</p>\r\n<p>Regardless, it looks like the ID changed in 7.1 for some reason.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-10-28T02:32:39Z"}]}
