{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1630] Pvp trinket + every man? ","body":" <p>Come to love this addon but still kinda new to it. Trying to create a icon that lets me know when target have their gladiators medallion / every man for itself on cd or not. Used unit cooldown then&nbsp;<strong>Gladiator's Medallion: 2:00; Every Man for Himself: 3:00&nbsp;</strong>but it only tracks Gladiators Medallion? Or do I need to do 2 separate icons? And is it possible to only show the icon if the target HAVE either of them? Like they shouldt show if im facin a gnome with no every man and no gladiators? Hope you guys understand me ^^ Cheers&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Fogelberg86\">Fogelberg86</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1630\">#1630</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1630.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-25T00:06:05Z","created_at":"2018-12-14T10:28:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T00:06:05Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Made 2 separete groups and icons and put them above each other so got it to work.
