{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1082] Tell if a spell has been cast recently ","body":" <p>Hey Cy. Got a stumped problem here I am hoping you can help me with.</p><p>I use \"Spell Cast = Absent/Present\" to tell if I am casting a spell, (eg: chaos bolt with a long cast time, or immolate since the debuff does not show until I finish casting) so I can prepare the next icon to show. The other case is an instant cast spell, eg: Affliction, where I can test if a debuff has been applied to the target. These work fine.</p><p>Here's my problem - two examples come to mind Immedietly: Serpent Sting (Surv Hunter), Hand of Gul'dan (Demo Lock). These are instant cast, but due to long animation time they do not show a debuff on the target immedietly. The solution that comes to mind is to be able to basically condition \"Spell has been cast within the last X seconds\".</p><p>Is this possible, or do you have another solution already that I missed?</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1082\">#1082</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1082.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-27T05:15:32Z","created_at":"2015-01-25T17:43:32Z","updated_at":"2015-01-27T05:15:32Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Use a Combat Event icon with a Timer notification.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-01-27T01:21:04Z"},{"body":" <p>Perfect, thanks.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a>","created_at":"2015-01-27T01:58:30Z"}]}
