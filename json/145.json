{"issue":{"title":"[CF 145] Group growth direction ","body":" <p>With the in v4.0.0 beta1 added option to check for sub-metas, TMW can now show dynamicaly growing lists of icons.</p><p>However, in it's current state these lists can only grow to the left or down - you can't set groth direction to right or up.<br>I guess that adding an option in the group settings that allows columns to expand to left or right, and rows to top or bottom would be an easy way to implement such a behavior.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Twister\">Twister</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/145\">#145</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/145.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-03-30T22:50:51Z","created_at":"2011-03-24T11:41:38Z","updated_at":"2011-03-30T22:50:51Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I had a better idea regarding the method in which icons are updated that should both increase efficiency, and make this easily possible. I will probably add one option that affects the order in which groups are checked, and another option to be set per group that will affect the order in which icons within that group are checked.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-03-26T19:39:21Z"}]}
