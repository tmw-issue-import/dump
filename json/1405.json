{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1405] /tmw &amp; /tellmewhen not working ","body":" <p>Today for some reason /tmw &amp; /tellmewhen are not working. When trying to type it in all I get is \"Type /help for a list of command\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Today I installed wowinterface's add client Minion, as was trying out a UI addon and had quite a few components, and there were a couple of addons that had updates (or so it said). So anyway I updated them and long story short the UI addon didn't work out as I didn't like it so uninstalled it.</p>\r\n<p>So now that I'm trying to play wow I noticed my TMW \"buttons\" weren't showing up. So I typed /tmw and it wasn't working. I disabled all addons besides TMW and it still didn't work.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any way to fix this without me having to delete my WTF folder as I don't want to loose all my addon settings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few screenshots:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/dVTtY\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/a/dVTtY</a></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cyph1n\">Cyph1n</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1405\">#1405</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1405.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-04-29T17:44:03Z","created_at":"2017-04-29T14:56:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-29T17:44:20Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Ok I got it working again.
