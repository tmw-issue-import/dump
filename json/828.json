{"issue":{"title":"[CF 828] compare current combat stats to baseline stats ","body":" <p>Hi</p><p>Your addon is great but there's one thing missing to be perfect: a condition to directly evaluate short buffs (trinkets, heroism, cooldowns...) combined power.<br>Something like: 100 - ((\"baseline combat stats\" + \"baseline buffs\") * 100 / \"current combat stats\").<br>\"baseline stats\" = primary stat * haste * crit * mastery provided by gears<br>\"baseline buffs\" = primary stat * haste * crit * mastery provided by group/raid<br>\"current combat stats\" = total current primary stat * haste * crit * mastery</p><p>So the result will be an estimation in percent of combined short buffs. I know it's not perfect for all abilities, because they have specific formulas and coefficients but most of the time all the buffed stats are relevant and it would give a pretty accurate and useful result. Maybe it would be misleading for some unusual abilities but a disclaimer should do the trick...</p><p>Perhaps we could achieve similar results currently but it would require too many intricate conditions and have this information directly available would simplify many setup.</p><p>If it's a too big job or inefficient to include it in tellmewhen maybe you could use the information from other addons like mesmash!

They are many short buffs with different stats/values. On my warlock, I have to assess 9 potential short buffs + 2 raid short buffs + combat specifics buffs, even if I forget the smaller, I couldn't realistically setup reliable rules with the current options. And I don't think it's specific to warlock.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover And/Or logical operators are not enough to evaluate combat stats correctly, to evaluate combined dps buff of an ability we need some others mathematical operators (* , / , + , -) and that would need an almost complete redesign of the addon... </p>\r\n<p>So, here is my solution...</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"06 24 2013 05:55:22 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1372071322\">Jun 24, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/fluxtendu\">fluxtendu</a>","created_at":"2013-06-24T10:25:01Z"},{"body":" <p>TellMeWhen is no longer in active development, so there is just no chance that this will be implemented.
