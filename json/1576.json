{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1576] Pillar of Frost and Unholy Strength ","body":" <p>Heyo, so ive started using your addon recently, mainly to track Coldheart and its stacks relatively close to the center of my screen, with the \"4 blocks\". That part is working perfectly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Im now trying to set up Pillar of Frost, as well as Unholy Strength procs to show up in the adjacent blocks, but im not finding any success in doing that. What id like is to to simply see the remaining time while Pillar of Frost is active, as well as remainding time of my Unholy Strength when thats procced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sorry if this is easy and im missing something, brand new to your addon, love it so far though</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/thisisnoterico\">thisisnoterico</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1576\">#1576</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1576.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-10-22T00:54:40Z","created_at":"2018-09-10T17:28:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T00:54:40Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You'll have to show me what you've tried so far.
