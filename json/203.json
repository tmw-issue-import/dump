{"issue":{"title":"[CF 203] Request: Chat Bubbles ","body":" <p>Posting this ticket here, as opposed to curse.com at your request... Pretty self explanatory, but essentially an option to have a chat bubble pop up as a response to a buff/debuff/event/etc. It's the standard \"I'm the bomb\" type of response, without the need for memory intensive boss mods.</p><p>I hope you don't let the brevity of this ticket detract from its importance. I truly think this is an excellent change for the addon and I was really surprised it wasn't implemented before you bumped in the sound list.</p><p>In any case, \"Love the addon\" I always tell everyone that if you could only raid with one addon, that this is the one to take.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/booi\">booi</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/203\">#203</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/203.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-05-21T04:53:17Z","created_at":"2011-05-17T22:40:54Z","updated_at":"2011-05-21T04:53:17Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Sorry about the assholeishness of the other ticket.
