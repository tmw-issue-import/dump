{"issue":{"title":"[CF 300] Spell Name in the binding text and text output ","body":" <p>Is there any way you could create a binding to the unit name and spell name so it can be used in the Binding Text area.<br>A lot of addons have a huge shortcoming of not providing a label to their icon frames.&nbsp; This one is exception but this main functionality is missing.<br>Hopefully the information is in the cache already.</p><p>usage: If I have an enemy CD frame (I have 3 groups of 7 icons) I hate to have to scan these and think about what icon means what.<br>i.e. I have an enemy burst icon (pillar of frost, reclessness etc.) is there a way to show the name of the spell detected in the BInding Text?<br>Thanks&nbsp; a lot for your work.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ElectricMenace\">ElectricMenace</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/300\">#300</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/300.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-10-14T05:39:41Z","created_at":"2011-10-05T15:14:42Z","updated_at":"2011-10-14T05:39:41Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Just wanted to let you know that I saw your ticket here. Deleting your comment on Curse.com to keep things in one place.</p>\r\n<p>Deleted comment:</p>\r\n<p>ElectricMenace said\r\nThursday, October 06, 2011 11:47:27 AM (6 hours ago)\r\nOpened an enhancement ticket on forge but could you please create a variable (something like %s) for the binding text so it can change dynamically with the spell detected. In your HandleEvent() you're already passing the data object for the icon that should be able to retrieve the GetSpellInfo if I'm reading the code right.\r\ni.e I have a frame with all PvP abilities for all classes. Each icon represents a class of abilities (i.e. Pillar of Frost, Berserk, Recklesness,Shadowdance etc.), I want to be able to set the binding text for that icon to the spell that was detected so I don't have to remember 100 icons and try to figure it out. I ability per icon btw, multiple classes per icon though. So if arena1 unit is mage it will show Cold Snap if it is a rogue it will show Preparation.\r\nIt will also help to institute this same variable in the text output (you already support the %t in there for target).\r\nThank you again for all your hard work. Hopefully this will not be a big deal.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-10-07T01:38:24Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20300%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20300%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite>\r\nGoing to test a couple of things tonight in the function TMW:Icon_Update(icon)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ElectricMenace\">ElectricMenace</a>","created_at":"2011-10-10T15:38:50Z"},{"body":" <p>Where do you store the SpellID when the ability is detected?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ElectricMenace\">ElectricMenace</a>","created_at":"2011-10-12T03:51:35Z"},{"body":" <p>I don't.

To fit a full spell name or a full unit name, it will have to extend outside the icon's boundaries. I have added a setting to allow this instead of forcing the text's width to constrain to the icon. (but still haven't implemented the bind text substitutions. I will do that in a little bit.)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-10-14T00:26:26Z"}]}
