{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1574] No Timer Text over Item or Spell Cooldowns ","body":" <p>For the past few days I have been unable to see Timer Text over Spell or Item Cooldowns. The visual sweep animation occurs, but the timer text does not show (with the Timer Text enabled). These are all on TMW setups that have worked for months (if not years) so far.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have tried to see if any of my other addons are interfering by disabling all but TMW and OmniCC with no luck. Disabling OmniCC and enabling the default Blizzard Timer Text works.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>OmniCC works with my other addons (or action bars). I have reinstalled both OmniCC and TMW (without clearing data). Also tested on a character that did not have any TMW data setup before with the same result.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Am I missing something?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Dwel\">Dwel</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1574\">#1574</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1574.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-10-22T02:17:47Z","created_at":"2018-09-05T16:29:25Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T02:17:47Z","labels":["question","cantfix"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The same thing is happening to me.
