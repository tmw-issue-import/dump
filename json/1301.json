However if I'm not adding it there it might be that the data fetching will be much less optimized.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a>","created_at":"2018-09-26T08:05:22Z"}]}
