{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1510] Bar color per spell ","body":" <p>Trying to recreate the setup from RoguePowerBars addon, which finally stopped working in 8.0. There, you could set up a group of spells to be shown as bars and select a solid color for each bar independently. In TMW, it seems that you can only set up the bar color per whole group?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible to set up different color bars for spells within one group? If not, can this issue be a request to implement this?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nordveien\">nordveien</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1510\">#1510</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1510.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-07-19T04:22:27Z","created_at":"2018-07-19T03:43:16Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T04:22:27Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Found it, the setting is under individual icon &gt; Timer Bar &gt; Override Group Color</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sorry about this issue, closing.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nordveien\">nordveien</a>","created_at":"2018-07-19T04:22:27Z"}]}
