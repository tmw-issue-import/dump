{"issue":{"title":"[CF 693] Icon Tooltip and little more ","body":" <p>Just some thoughts on how to enhance this addon as I'm looking forward to use it as a future replacement for Raven/Aura Frames/Satrina Buff Frames.</p><p>Buff/debuff icon type:<br>1. Show tooltip - Yes/No<br>2. Show spell tooltip (only when buff/debuff is missing) - Yes/No (active only when first option is set to \"yes\")<br>3. Show in combat - Yes/No (active only when first option is set to \"yes\")<br>4. Right click to cancel - Yes/No (of course it works out of combat only)</p><p>Any spell (item or spell cooldowns, multistate, reactive abilities etc.) icon type:<br>1. Show tooltip - Yes/No<br>2. Show when absent (e.g. Healthstone may not be present in bags, some talent might not be chosen) - Yes/No (active only when first option is set to \"yes\")<br>3. Show in combat - Yes/No (active only when first option is set to \"yes\")</p><p>Hope you like these ideas!
