{"issue":{"title":"[CF 168] Not working quite right ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: Attaching a saved variables file/screenshot will increase the likelihood of your problem being solved.<br>Saved variables can be found in: \"World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/&lt;Account Name&gt;/SavedVariables/TellMeWhen. lua\"</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. There are many</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>There are many icons that I can't seem to get working in this version. I've included my saved variables and I'll list some examples as best as I can, sorry if it's so large I have plenty of alts with an elaborate display of icons.</p><p>Profile: Debria - Ragnaros<br>Group: 15 - Icon: 9<br>This icon is meant to show Combustion when it's available, it's checks that I'm combat, fire spec, and checks for the debuffs Living Bomb, Ignite and Pyroblast! on my target. It never shows, apparently the debuff check isn't working, if I make other icons with the debuffs and check those instead the icon works as intended.</p><p>Profile: Rubaina - Ragnaros<br>Group 14 - Icon: 1<br>This icon is supposed to track Prayer of Mending in a party. Can't get it to show, it works if I put to check player, but it doesn't work when checking the party</p><p>Profile: Yoshe - Ragnaros<br>Group 13 - Icon 4<br>This icon checks for when I'm missing the Inquisition debuff in my paladin, however it's set to only show only when I'm retribution, yet it still shows when I'm protection.</p><p>I suppose I can reconfigure around these issues to get each example to work, but hopefully this will help find issues with the addon you might have missed, or maybe I'm doing something wrong? I've check them many times trying to find out if I'm the one doing something wrong but I can't figure anything out.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
