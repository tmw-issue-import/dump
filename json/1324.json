{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1324] Option to Hide Groups in Config Mode ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using now? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>v8.2.0</p><p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?</p><p>Allow the option to hide specific groups while in config mode. This could simply be a checkbox in the Group tab.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>I have a lot of groups I use purely for notifications in 5-man dungeons. It would be nice to be able to have them hidden so they do not clutter up my screen when I am modifying my combat-related TMW's. If I need to modify them after hiding, I can simply select them in the Group Select dropdown and uncheck the hide option.</p><p>Thank you.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Zinodax\">Zinodax</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1324\">#1324</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1324.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-27T02:12:34Z","created_at":"2016-10-26T08:41:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T02:12:48Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>just scale them really small and stick them in the corner</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-10-27T02:12:48Z"}]}
