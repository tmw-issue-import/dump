{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1017] [patch] track combo points on player, even with no target ","body":" <p>combo points on the player can be obtained with UnitPower(\"player\", 4)</p><p> I hacked Components/IconTypes/IconType_value/value.lua in the quickest and dirtiest way possible, to see if it would work:</p><p>-- line 156<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; elseif PowerType == 100 then -- combo points<br>--&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value, maxValue = GetComboPoints(\"player\", \"target\"), 5<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value, maxValue = UnitPower(\"player\", 4), 5</p><p>It does work.&nbsp; You'll probably want to take out all the special-casing of combo points and just have them go through the same codepath as other player resources, now that they are a player resource, not a target thing, so I didn't bother to make an actual diff of just changing one line.</p><p> I've been playing around with using TMW to make bars to track my health and energy, and combo points, on my lowbie rogue.&nbsp; I should maybe just get a unit frames mod instead of implementing it myself with TMW, and get back the screen real estate from where I also have the blizz-UI self / target portraits.&nbsp; But I'm so used to them. :P</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Karsteck\">Karsteck</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1017\">#1017</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1017.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-11-02T01:41:19Z","created_at":"2014-11-01T06:41:26Z","updated_at":"2014-11-02T01:41:19Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Thanks.
