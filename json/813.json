{"issue":{"title":"[CF 813] Show icon if poison/disease ","body":" <p>Hello again! I am trying to work on my icons for my Brewmaster monk. One that I am not sure how to do on my own is for the skill Detox, which removes Disease or Poison. I would like to track either of those debuffs on myself and show the Detox icon so I know when I can dispel them.
