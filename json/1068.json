{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1068] Animation recheck ","body":" <p>im using an image overlay on icons to show, lack of combopoints and lack of range to target. If i have little combopoints the first overlay appears. If the combopoint is appearing and i step out of range it is overwritten by the lack of range. This in itself is fine as i dont want overlapping overlays, but if i step back into range, the icon does not show any animation at all even though i lack the combo points. It seems animations could use a recheck at the end of one to see if other animations on the icon still have conditions that are met. Also a priority of animations would be nice.</p><p>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SOnlyShown^B ^Sa_anim^N0.31 ^SImage^S87840 ^SPeriod^N0 ^SAnimation^SICONOVERLAYIMG ^SEvent^SWCSP ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&gt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N5 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SOnlyShown^B ^Sa_anim^N0.3 ^SImage^S59563 ^SPeriod^N0 ^SAnimation^SICONOVERLAYIMG ^SEvent^SWCSP ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOMBO ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SLevel^N5 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SCustomTex^S1079 ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SEXISTS ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SEnabled^B ^t^N72218^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/shisagi\">shisagi</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1068\">#1068</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1068.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-12T04:08:17Z","created_at":"2015-01-11T09:55:37Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T04:08:17Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Fixed in g2b97d3c.</p>\r\n<blockquote><cite>Quote:</cite><p>While Condition Set Passing-triggered animations now work on a priority system, with those notifications higher in the configuration list having priority over lower-ranked notifications if both are eligible to play at the same time.
