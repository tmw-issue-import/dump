{"issue":{"title":"[CF 373] Condition: Absolute Health ","body":" <p>Simple request: Could you build a condition option to check for an absolute health (mana) value with &lt;&gt;= operators? That way I could let my rotation-metaicon adapt a new rotation for mobs that won't last long and skip such things as Rend or stacking Sunder Armor. If it's not clear: relative health doesn't work on mobs that only have 1000 life to begin with.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/373\">#373</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/373.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-12-09T02:47:00Z","created_at":"2011-12-07T15:37:54Z","updated_at":"2011-12-09T02:47:00Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I should probably put these as real conditions.
