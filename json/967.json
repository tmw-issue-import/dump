Its just the way that the packager works. There is no harm done by this. Those files don't even get looked at or loaded unless the library is loaded as a standalone addon, which it isn't. LibStub, for example, is included 8 times throughout TellMeWhen's libraries.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 12 2014 11:59:43 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1405184383\">Jul 12, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-07-12T16:57:23Z"}]}
