{"issue":{"title":"[CF 454] Manage Crit Spell in Combat Event ","body":" <p>I really love TMW and in order to manage efficiently my fire mage combustion (and as I am not a fan of Combustion Helper) I wanted to have the possibility to detect critic spell damages in TellMeWhen. To do so, I needed an icon to be shown when my Fireball or Pyroblast did critical damages.</p><p>I did a patch I tested on my side which seems to work (attached). My patch is for TMW and TMW_Options.</p><p>I let you choose whether this functionality should be added or not to TellMeWhen.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/feuxeu77\">feuxeu77</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/454\">#454</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/454.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-03-01T22:44:46Z","created_at":"2012-03-01T14:50:11Z","updated_at":"2012-03-01T22:44:46Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/52/spell_crit.diff\" target=\"_blank\"> spell_crit.diff</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">spell_crit.diff</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;Patch to add Spell Crit detection&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/feuxeu77\">feuxeu77</a>","created_at":"2012-03-01T14:50:11Z"},{"body":" <p>I had to make a few minor changes, but I have implemented this in r490.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-03-01T22:44:46Z"}]}
