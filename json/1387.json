{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1387] How can I display the inner-text value of a buff? ","body":" <p>The trinket <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/item=144249/archimondes-hatred-reborn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Archimonde's Hatred Reborn</a>&nbsp;creates a buff that deals damage according to how much damage was absorbed by it. I would like to track how much damage that is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The buff it creates is <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=235169/archimondes-hatred-reborn\" rel=\"nofollow\">of the same name</a>, and the damage absorbed is indicated as part of the buff text. Is there a function to extract that text? Currently I'm using [TotalAbs] and as it goes down so I have some indication but it's not really what I'm looking for :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1387\">#1387</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1387.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-03-05T07:26:19Z","created_at":"2017-02-24T06:51:15Z","updated_at":"2017-03-05T07:26:19Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Nevermind - figured out Stacks works great, and that I can even use the menu to select specific values.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a>","created_at":"2017-03-05T07:26:19Z"}]}
