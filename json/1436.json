Its hardcoded to only work for mana, rage, energy, runic power, and focus, so it doesn't even work for DH or Monk, or other special resources like Maelstrom and Lunar. The colors themselves are hardcoded as well - they aren't based off of the color of the bar.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 5 2017 22:35:44 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1501990544\">Aug 5, 2017</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-08-06T03:32:04Z"},{"body":" <p>I forgot to make a point - the point was that the tag doesn't return standard power bar colors - it seems to use colors that are less saturated than normal.
