{"issue":{"title":"[CF 553] \"Show variable text\" not working, instead lagging client ","body":" <p>The option \"Show variable text\" for tracking buffs/debuffs doesn't seem to work and instead, when checked, the client is lagging for the duration of the buff. Though, his doesn't seem to be the case with every buff, I tested it with Shield of the Righteous (3sec) and Hand of Freedom. It may only be the case when there is no variable to show (though I thought that Shield of the Righteous should show one)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/_dAda\">_dAda</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/553\">#553</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/553.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-08-30T03:39:44Z","created_at":"2012-08-29T22:17:22Z","updated_at":"2012-08-30T03:39:44Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Not invalid, actually.
