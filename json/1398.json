{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1398] Prot. Warrior Ravager, Impending Victory talent skill in v8.3.3 ","body":" <p>Before TMW v8.3.3 Prot. Warrior's Ravager and Impending Victory are only shown when the talents are chosen. However, in v8.3.3 both are shown even though neither talent is chosen.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I can bypass this problem by adding a condition that checks if the talent is learned, however I suspect this is a new bug introduced in v8.3.3.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bong</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BongKim\">BongKim</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1398\">#1398</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1398.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-04-30T05:17:34Z","created_at":"2017-04-02T21:37:49Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T05:18:20Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <div>\r\n<p>Blizzard broke this.
