{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1518] Shaman Elementals ","body":" <p>Need to track Elemental durations. Since they are no longer totems, you can't track them. I think you could just use the same Consecration tracker from Paladins.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also it would be nice to be able to Identify that your Elemental is up. I am currently tracking the CD on their special abilities and would like to show only when my elemental exists. Currently using Unit Exists condition but that also shows when other Shamans summon their Elemental.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Yakuzaii\">Yakuzaii</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1518\">#1518</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1518.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-07-21T01:47:55Z","created_at":"2018-07-20T19:01:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-21T19:30:03Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Greater Fire Elemental can indeed still be tracked as a totem.
