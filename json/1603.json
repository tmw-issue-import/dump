{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1603] TMW not processing multiple spell interrupted combat event auras ","body":" <p>g6731d197-alpha and&nbsp;g6bc49450-alpha&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As part of a group to track spell lockout duration on my healer, I use multiple combat event auras with various conditions to be able to generate an aura for the specific lockout. However, I believe that if there are multiple combat event icons all tracking Interrupt - Spell Interrupted, TMW will only allow the first one in the group to process events, and will ignore all others (even if the other ones should be the proper ones processed).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SSourceConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCLASS2 ^SBitFlags^N2148 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SType^Scleu ^SCLEUDur^N3 ^SGUID^STMW:icon:1Rqk4515s4eq ^SSourceUnit^Sarena1;~`arena2;~`arena3 ^SShowTimerTextnoOCC^B ^SCLEUEvents^T ^SSPELL_INTERRUPT^B ^t^SCustomTex^SInterface/AddOns/NameplateAuras/media/warrior_disruptingshout.tga ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^SDestUnit^Sparty1;~`party2;~`player ^SEnabled^B ^t^N85502^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SSourceConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCLASS2 ^SBitFlags^N1539 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SType^Scleu ^SCLEUDur^N4 ^SGUID^STMW:icon:1RqkcjElAtjC ^SSourceUnit^Sarena1;~`arena2;~`arena3 ^SShowTimerTextnoOCC^B ^SCLEUEvents^T ^SSPELL_INTERRUPT^B ^t^SCustomTex^SInterface/AddOns/NameplateAuras/media/warrior_disruptingshout.tga ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^SDestUnit^Sparty1;~`party2;~`player ^SEnabled^B ^t^N85502^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examples of said auras.

The first instance of a spell interrupted combat event aura is icon 3, the rest are the ones 38-41. For some reason icon 38 usually has no problem showing up no matter what the conditionals are...but the other ones (for classes w/a lockout longer than 3s) aren't showing up when they should. Possible that the conflict is something to do with multiple combat event auras in the same group tracking the same sources/destinations for the same events?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1603\">#1603</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1603.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-11-05T07:11:12Z","created_at":"2018-10-26T11:13:05Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T07:11:12Z","labels":["defect"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Putting the auras in different groups entirely fixed nothing.
