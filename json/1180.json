{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1180] Overlapping window control ","body":" <p>Hi,</p><p>I use a lot of TMW groups when raiding, generally one for each boss encounter so I can clearly track what I need to.&nbsp; I place each of the groups in the same place on the screen so I always know where to look (see screenshot).&nbsp; The problem is that this ends up with up to 13 groups all sitting on top of one another and makes finding the one you need troublesome.&nbsp; I was wondering if there could be a way to select which group you want to edit using either the Main Options to select or hide the selected group.&nbsp; The reason is that although you can right click and select through to the icon you want, you dont know if its there or which slot its sitting in unless you can see the group frame.</p><p>Hopefully the pic will show you the problem.&nbsp; Buried in there is a Fel Rage debuff for the Counsel fight but unless I click all over the place I cant find it.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mattstorr\">mattstorr</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1180\">#1180</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1180.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-02-18T19:11:45Z","created_at":"2015-11-22T18:00:16Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T19:11:45Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/84/overlapping_menus.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"> overlapping_menus.PNG</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/84/overlapping_menus.PNG\" title=\"overlapping_menus.PNG\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/84/126/126/overlapping_menus.PNG\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">overlapping_menus.PNG</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mattstorr\">mattstorr</a>","created_at":"2015-11-22T18:00:16Z"},{"body":" <p>This is why meta icons exist.
