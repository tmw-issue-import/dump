This is happening because TMW is reading settings that have not gone through the upgrade process that will fix this issue. Once settings are actually imported, the issue will disappear, but until then it really isn't an issue because the text layout that this is occurring with isn't actually being used to layout texts.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-22T22:24:04Z"}]}
