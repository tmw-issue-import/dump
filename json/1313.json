{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1313] Spinning crane kick ","body":" <p>Hi. Is it possible due to monk's \"Spinning Crane Kick\" mechanics to set the condition which would show if i already got the stack from current mob or not? Looks like there is no intended tools but may be you could share some Lua condtion or implement smth in the future. Im sure im not the only one who may need it since there is no way to track it and that's confusing.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Digitl\">Digitl</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1313\">#1313</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1313.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-17T06:13:28Z","created_at":"2016-10-09T20:51:31Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T06:13:28Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Uhh, it puts a debuff on your target called \"Mark of the Crane\".
