{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1216] Combo point conditions not working (Legion) ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Make an icon with a condition to show if target has more than x combo points<br>2. Build some combo points<br>3. Icon will not show</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>The icon doesn't show up. Suspect this is because combo points in legion are on the rogue himself, and the combo point resource type is hardcoded to look at target.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>7.4.0-90-g5722601</p><p>Bonus information<br>Noted some erratic behaviour. When setting the number of combo points to look for to &gt; 0 the icon will show up, but will never go away again, even if all combo points are spent.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/kdhiin\">kdhiin</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1216\">#1216</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1216.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-06-07T20:12:21Z","created_at":"2016-05-27T18:48:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T20:12:21Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Just a changed event.
