{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1093] Possible to evaluate keypress as condition? ","body":" <p>I have been looking all day to see if there is an easy way to evaluate a condition based on a keypress?</p><p>Say for example I have a set with a keybind of ctrl+F for a spell to cast in a rotation. If I do not want to check to see if the spell is cast but if I managed to press the appropriate keybinding is that possible?</p><p>This would help to enable a notification so I could see on screen that I am not fat fingering keys. The main reason I am doing this is to train myself in new key presses in a sort of screen flash/Pavlovian way.</p><p>So What I see is Lua (advanced) as an option but it is messing with my head because I can't see an easy way to add scripting for an onkeyup or onkeydown logic check.</p><p>While I can use a mod: command in the macro part, I do not want to solely monitor a modifier key as that would trigger whenever I hold down said key (such as CTRL) and that wouldn't evaluate the condition of the key combo I want (CTRL + F) for example.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/transitbus\">transitbus</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1093\">#1093</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1093.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-03-02T04:58:07Z","created_at":"2015-02-28T21:01:03Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T04:58:07Z","labels":["declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is beyond the scope of TellMeWhen.
