{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1308] Affliction Warlock Corruption Spell ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Similarly, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Backup\". Select the \"To string\" option for the appropriate export type for your issue, and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. When specced to Affliction Warlock, Corruption (Icon Type: Buff/Debuff) does not register with TellMeWhen. The spell is actually being applied, as shown in the WoW debuff area, but in TMW it shows as Absent.<br>2. The other DoTs, Agony, Drain Soul, Siphon Life, Unstable Affliction all work as expected in TMW.<br>3. It might or might not be coincidental, but the the error appeared the day after the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition patch was pushed to my computer.</p><p>Export string is below.</p><p>What do you expect to happen?
