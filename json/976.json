{"issue":{"title":"[CF 976] [Beta] Skin Conflicts w/ElvUI ","body":" <p><a href=\"http://puu.sh/aoRkj/04092010db.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/aoRkj/04092010db.jpg</a></p><p>Turning off Ace3 skinning in ElvUI fixes this by not skinning TMW, but I figure I might as well report the conflict. Not entirely sure if I should be reporting this to you or to Elv, so feel free to tell me \"It's his problem not mine\" and close the ticket. If you need a version of the Elv beta to troubleshoot, lemme know and I can upload you the lastest build and send it to you.</p><p>E: On the Elv beta git, there have been some newer builds which note that they fix some issues w/Ace3 skinning. Might have fixed itself but I won't know until servers come back up.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/976\">#976</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/976.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-07-27T19:32:24Z","created_at":"2014-07-24T08:08:42Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T19:32:24Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p><a href=\"http://puu.sh/aoSgV/a662dbb315.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/aoSgV/a662dbb315.jpg</a></p>\r\n<p>Also, probably add Gladiator Stance to this condition list.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2014-07-24T08:23:10Z"},{"body":" <p>'Item is Equipped' conditions also seem to be broken.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2014-07-24T08:40:28Z"},{"body":" <p>Definitely ElvUI's problem.

Trying to make a working spell cooldown aura for Gladiator Stance's \"Shield Charge\" ability. For some reason the aura won't show up as it should. When I try to track a similar ability (charge with the Double Time talent), it tracks perfectly fine, so it has to be something with this ability specifically (and as such might be on Blizzard's end). I've tried tracking by naming it Shield Charge, Shield Block (the ability shield charge replaces by spec'ing into glad stance), and by setting the exact spell ID.\r\n<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/bQYhynRS\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/bQYhynRS</a></p>\r\n</blockquote> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-07-26T03:48:37Z"},{"body":" <p>Like I said, it works now that I put the <em>exact</em> spellID of the spell that gets replaced by Shield Charge (2565), but won't work if you simply input the name of Shield Block/Shield Charge, or specifically list Shield Charge by ID.
