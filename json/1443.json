{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1443] Reducing size of Blizzard's default cooldown text ","body":" <p>Hey Cybeloras,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the amazing addon! Been using it for the past 2 years, despite the guild pushing towards WeakAuras. I still much prefer yours!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just a quick question - OmniCC's being acting up lately, kicking out all sorts of lua errors, so I've defaulted to Blizz's cooldown timer instead. The thing is the size of the text pretty large, and in some cases, extend outside my icons (especially when its showing 1:xx).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I dont mind the formatting, but is there anyway to reduce the size of the text? I've tried looking through General options, but didnt find would help.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks in advance. Much appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/barnabus1234\">barnabus1234</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1443\">#1443</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1443.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-10-14T20:51:27Z","created_at":"2017-10-13T18:01:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-14T20:51:27Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>TMW has zero control over Blizzard's text.
