Open the WoW launcher, go into the Options menu, select Game Preferences, and enable the option to launch the 32 bit client. Then, start WoW.

I will see if I can find any dirfferences between the curse client download and the regular file download. I am baffled as to why the curse client fixed things, but as you said, I won't look a gift horse in the mouth! I did recommend installing through the curse client in the other ticket, and I didn't get any response, so maybe that fixed it for other people as well. At least now I know that this is a way to fix the problem!
