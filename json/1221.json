{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1221] Icons are not shown (Tank spec) ","body":" <p>Hi,</p><p>first of all, thank you for your great work with this addon. It's very useful to track my rotation and cooldowns. However, I've got an error with all the characters wich have activated the tank specialization (it works fine with DPS and heal).</p><p>When I change any spec to tank I see one LUA error (pictures 1 and 2) and after typing /tmw it appears another one (pictures 3, 4 and 5). Moreover, when I create a new profile group I get another error (pictures 6 and 7) and it doesn't matter what I do that it doesn't work properly.</p><p>Because of this I cannot see or modify the icon bars created and for this reason my tracks are not shown during tank spec. I'm using the version 7.4.0-103-g1f5302c.</p><p>Picture 1: <a href=\"http://oi64.tinypic.com/14mt26t.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi64.tinypic.com/14mt26t.jpg</a><br>Picture 2: <a href=\"http://oi68.tinypic.com/1zfoj8x.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi68.tinypic.com/1zfoj8x.jpg</a><br>Picture 3: <a href=\"http://oi67.tinypic.com/vffrsl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi67.tinypic.com/vffrsl.jpg</a><br>Picture 4: <a href=\"http://oi65.tinypic.com/2zgywxj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi65.tinypic.com/2zgywxj.jpg</a><br>Picture 5: <a href=\"http://oi68.tinypic.com/2njy007.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi68.tinypic.com/2njy007.jpg</a><br>Picture 6: <a href=\"http://oi68.tinypic.com/2ykffpj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi68.tinypic.com/2ykffpj.jpg</a><br>Picture 7: <a href=\"http://oi66.tinypic.com/j95a9v.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oi66.tinypic.com/j95a9v.jpg</a></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/dajope\">dajope</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1221\">#1221</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1221.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-11T04:29:16Z","created_at":"2016-06-26T10:18:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T04:29:23Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Thanks for the report.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-11T04:29:23Z"}]}
