{"issue":{"title":"[CF 547] TellMeWhen_Options out of date after upgrade ","body":" <p>Just downloaded TMW for the first time after patch 5.0.4 hit (version 6.0.1). When I attempt to open the addon (with /tmw or /tellmewhen) I get the following messages in my chatbox:</p><p>TellMeWhen: Loading TellMeWhen_Options<br>TellMeWhen: TellMeWhen_Options could not be loaded: Out of date</p><p>The TellMeWhen tab in my Interface&gt;Addons menu is also completely blank. It exists, but there's nothing in it.</p><p>Of course the obvious answer would be that it isn't updated for 5.0.4 but I'm seeing that other people have it working fine. Will attach my TellMeWhen.lua in case it helps</p><p>Thanks, and sorry if it's something stupid :P</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/JasonK33\">JasonK33</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/547\">#547</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/547.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-08-29T03:24:28Z","created_at":"2012-08-29T03:08:58Z","updated_at":"2012-08-29T03:24:28Z","labels":["defect","duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/75/TellMeWhen.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen.lua</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/JasonK33\">JasonK33</a>","created_at":"2012-08-29T03:08:58Z"},{"body":" <p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20543%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/543-options-out-of-date/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-29T03:23:34Z"}]}
