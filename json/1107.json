{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1107] maintank+mainassist targets sometimes do not work ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?</p><p>as resto shaman i set 2 sets of icons to track Earth Shield and Riptide buffs, one set tracking maintank and the other set tracking mainassist.<br>they work reasonably well in an organised raid group BUT...</p><p>if you join a LFR group you immediately find out that both tanks in LFR are tagged by default by Blizzard as \"maintank\"... wtf?!<br>if the random raid leader bothers to set the second tank as main assist then it works properly.. but they rarely bother to do this.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>maintank targets confuse between the 2 main tanks and will show whatever tank matches the conditions.. it cannot differentiate between them.</p><p>[b]would it be possible to also add maintank1 and maintank2 targets to differentiate between them?[/b]</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
