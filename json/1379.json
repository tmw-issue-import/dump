{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1379] Prot. Warrior Shield Slam proc ","body":" <p>Thanks for the Prot. Warrior love in the newest release.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now, I can make the the border of TWM Revenge icon sparkle by checking if Revenge's cost is equal to zero.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, I can't still make the border of TWM Shield Slam icon sparkle because Shield Slam has no cost. Whenever Shield Slam procs, the action bar button's border sparkles, but I can't make TWM icon sparkle according to this proc.&nbsp;It would be great if there's a condition check if there's a sparkling border in the action bar.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BongKim\">BongKim</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1379\">#1379</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1379.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-02-18T01:47:35Z","created_at":"2017-02-14T07:05:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-18T01:47:35Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
