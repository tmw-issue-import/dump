Just saying that it doesn't work isn't going to get the issue resolved. Also, please post the export string of the icon(s) that you are having trouble with. To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Restore\". Select the \"To string\" ... \"Icon: #\" option, and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 17 2014 21:00:51 (CDT) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1390014051\">Jan 17, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-01-18T03:00:16Z"}]}
