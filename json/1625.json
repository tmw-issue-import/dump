{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1625] [8.1] Certain meta icons create 'deadzones' for clicks ","body":" <p>ga6663e4d</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Similar to an issue I reported in WOD alpha, if you remember it. The area at and around some meta icons creates a deadzone for clicks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Disabling the groups, reloading, then reenabling them seems to make it work fine again though? Maybe temporary?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1625\">#1625</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1625.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-12T06:42:00Z","created_at":"2018-12-11T23:31:21Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T06:42:00Z","labels":["defect"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I've actually been hearing this a lot from people who don't even use TMW - possible this has nothing to do with TMW at all.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2018-12-12T00:46:03Z"},{"body":" <p>Use /framestack to see what frames are under your cursor.
