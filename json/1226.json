{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1226] Request to add a condition to check last spell cast ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>I was wondering if you have plans to add a condition to check last spell cast by player so that I can use tmw with my windwalker monk in Legion. The new ww mastery gives bonus dps so long as you don't use the same ability twice in a row. I'd love to be able to account for that in tmw.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/kc5680\">kc5680</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1226\">#1226</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1226.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-16T07:20:43Z","created_at":"2016-07-15T01:01:32Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T07:21:05Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Its now in the Player Attributes category</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-16T07:21:05Z"}]}
