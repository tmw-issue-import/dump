{"issue":{"title":"[CF 871] Hide Text Displays in Config ","body":" <p>I may have asked you about this once and you said this isn't possible, but I forget.</p><p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/j6Na682.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/j6Na682.jpg</a></p><p>Was wondering if you could make an option to make Text Displays (see the top left of image) not show up while in the /tmw config mode. Looks a bit gaudy and depending how big you set the text layout's text to, probably covers up other nearby auras, which could be a bit annoying.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Freeebo\">Freeebo</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/871\">#871</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/871.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-10-12T01:34:08Z","created_at":"2013-10-08T05:30:54Z","updated_at":"2013-10-12T01:34:08Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>No, there are no plans for this.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-10-12T01:33:43Z"}]}
