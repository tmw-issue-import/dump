Inspection can work on friendlies, but even inspection is limited by range and throttled by number of queries per min.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from that, you can only make assumptions based on auras present/spells cast. To do something like this would require a lot of lists of a lot of spells and buffs for a lot of specs for a lot of classes.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-04-27T04:38:26Z"},{"body":" <p>Out of curiosity since this ticket is still up, is there something you need from me on my end to get this rolling?

But what about other addons which fetch the spec of the person in question, could TMW have a way to check through that addon the spec for a condition?</p>\r\n<p>Example, GladiusEx (and all Gladius addons) retrieve the spec of the player on the enemy team via...well, however they do it. Would it be hard for TMW to check the arena frame/through the addon to have a condition that works only on arena1-5 specializations to activate?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2014-08-04T00:02:09Z"},{"body":" <p>Specs of enemies in arenas are pretty easy to get.
