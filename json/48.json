Set up an icon as a cooldown; I'm using the Paladin's 'Judgement' spell. Set it to show only when unusable. I also show a timer.<br>2. Use the spell. It should show the icon with the CD time remaining. Allow the CD to expire.<br>3. Use another spell which activates the global cooldown. The Judgement icon will show for the duration of the GCD.</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?<br>I expect my Judgement icon to show only when Judgement is on cooldown. What I see is that the Judgement icon also shows when the global cooldown is active.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?<br>1.5.4</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>It doesn't generate an error.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Furiant\">Furiant</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/48\">#48</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/48.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-11-21T06:55:14Z","created_at":"2010-11-20T13:29:33Z","updated_at":"2010-11-21T06:55:14Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>What level is this paladin?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 20 2010 14:48:56 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1290286136\">Nov 20, 2010</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-11-20T19:17:28Z"},{"body":" <p>28, and she's always had this issue. Thank you for looking into this.</p>\r\n<p>To be clear, I use TMW to track many other things on her than just Judgement. Crusader Strike, Consecration, Avenger's Shield, etc. I have these set up in 3 separate bars, and any invocation of the GCD will simultaneously light up all the cooldowns that I've set to show only when unuseable. </p>\r\n<p>I also have an icon set to show when the Righteous Fury threat self-buff is missing. It does not light up on the GCD while the buff is active.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 20 2010 22:04:22 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1290312262\">Nov 20, 2010</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Furiant\">Furiant</a>","created_at":"2010-11-21T03:09:22Z"},{"body":" <p>That is why. When I released the first cata version way back when, a few of the GCD spells had been removed, so someone gave me new IDs and I never gave them a second thought. Turns out that the new spells had much higher level requirements. The spell for paladins that was being checked was cleanse, trained at level 34 or something. I changed this last minute in 2.0.1 when I saw this ticket, as well as the mage spell that was trained around this same level.</p>\r\n<p>TL;DR: This is fixed in 2.0.1</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 20 2010 22:50:08 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1290315008\">Nov 20, 2010</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-11-21T04:49:35Z"},{"body":" <p>I'll download it now.
