I created such an icon to announce a successful interruption, in the announcement I wrote \"interrupted %s\" when this message showed on the screen, that %s was only replaced with the name of the spell but not a link to the spell(which you can click to see the details of the spell) I'm wondering is there any possibility to ouput a link of a spell, such as [Fear].</p>\r\n<p>2. When this announcement showed on the screen(not raid warning, similar to it but still working when you are alone), the font was too small and I'm wondering does it allow me to customize the font size since I could only customize its color.</p>\r\n<p>thank you very much </p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/a1204350\">a1204350</a>","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:15:57Z"},{"body":" <p>Spell links shouldn't be hard to do.

There may be addons out there that can make it bigger - I know that MoveAnything is able to resize it, but the text may look pixellated and/or the icon might not be aligned correctly with the text.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:38:26Z"},{"body":" <p>Added spell link to r396.
