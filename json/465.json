{"issue":{"title":"[CF 465] Raging Blow Enrage Requirement ","body":" <p>Hello, it is not an error I'm reporting, but rather an enhancement issue. What i want the Raging Blow icon to do is to be grayed out when im not enraged. I.e. I cant use the ability. Also i want it to be dim when i haven't enough rage, but I think there is already a setting for that. Hope you will implement the setting since it will help me as a fury warrior.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Miltiwarr\">Miltiwarr</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/465\">#465</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/465.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-02T07:25:18Z","created_at":"2012-03-14T14:01:28Z","updated_at":"2012-09-02T07:25:18Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>What you are actually asking for the the ability to color an icon if its conditions fail.

It just checks the cooldown.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-03-14T16:37:47Z"},{"body":" <p>Oh, I figured that the enrage requirement was covered by it being a reactive ability. I suggested to add a condition and have the alpha dim on his post over on the Curse page, but it seems that Miltiwarr would like the icon to be able to be grayed out instead of have a reduced alpha. </p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-03-14T21:29:14Z"},{"body":" <p>Is this still an issue for you?
