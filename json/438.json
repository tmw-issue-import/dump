{"issue":{"title":"[CF 438] Custom color for Icons ","body":" <p>This is a screenshoot of my TMW Groups:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.curseforge.com/media/attachments/24/239/tmw_groups.png\" alt=\"Groupsetup\"></p>\r\n<p>Each group with a <em>\"Display\"</em>-prefix contains only meta-icons which shows any of the icons setup in the groups with the <em>\"Data\"</em>-prefix. An example can be seen here, which shows my Groups 14 &amp; 15</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.curseforge.com/media/attachments/24/240/tmw_display.png\" alt=\"Example: Group 14 &amp; 15\"></p>\r\n<p>Seeing my group 20 &amp; 21, i've setup some Icons for the raidzones in there, and display them in my group 16. However: To be able to color these raidicons, i would have to put them in one of my data groups (1-7) or introduce new groups ie.\r\n<em>Data (4.3 Dragonsoul) (red)</em> ect. and put the icons displayed in group 16 there.</p>\r\n<p>Both soultions would work, but i'm not really satisfied with both of them.\r\nI'd prefer seeing a color tab added to the icon editor, which would make my groups 1-7 obsolete</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Twister\">Twister</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/438\">#438</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/438.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-02-09T01:47:57Z","created_at":"2012-02-07T14:19:16Z","updated_at":"2012-02-09T01:47:57Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/233/tmw_groups.png\" target=\"_blank\"> tmw_groups.png</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/233/tmw_groups.png\" title=\"tmw_groups.png\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/233/126/126/tmw_groups.png\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">tmw_groups.png</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Twister\">Twister</a>","created_at":"2012-02-07T14:19:16Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/234/tmw_display.png\" target=\"_blank\"> tmw_display.png</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/234/tmw_display.png\" title=\"tmw_display.png\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/234/126/126/tmw_display.png\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">tmw_display.png</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Twister\">Twister</a>","created_at":"2012-02-07T14:19:16Z"},{"body":" <p>This isn't going to happen.
