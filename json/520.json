I'm now fairly confident that it's not a specific condition like talent trees that's malfunctioning. Rather it appears that metaicons just aren't checking their conditions. I have a bunch of metaicons only checking for talent trees, which is what made me misidentify the problem.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-08-09T18:20:29Z"},{"body":" <p>Yeah, I just noticed this when i switched to my MM spec to do some pvp last night - I have a meta icon with some conditions to warn me if I am focus capped and should cast an aimed shot or an arcane shot.
