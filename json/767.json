{"issue":{"title":"[CF 767] Add Custom Timer to Buff/Debuff ","body":" <p>Would it be possible to add a custom, user-set timer to a Buff/Debuff? Some things I (and others) might want to track do not have durations, and are therefore slightly untrackable.</p><p>For example, I just obtained the Fabled Feather of Ji-Kun tonight, and the stacking buff that is applied via the proc has no timer. If I try tracking it via Combat Event, it won't show the stacks due to it only tracking the aura being applied, and nothing thereafter.</p><p>To answer a followup, yes I CAN track the \"Feathers of Fury\" buff, but that won't show me the stacks that \"Mighty\" has, which I'd like to be able to see.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jastain\">Jastain</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/767\">#767</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/767.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-03-19T07:31:55Z","created_at":"2013-03-18T06:39:29Z","updated_at":"2013-03-19T07:31:55Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You can always create two icons - one that will be used to get the timing information, and another that will be used to get the stack information.</p>\r\n<p>Set the [Stacks] tag on the icon that is used for the timing information to refer to the icon that gets the stack information.
