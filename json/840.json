You can currently do this with the non-ElvUI timer, but the ElvUI option gets grayed out if I disable the cooldown sweep portion.</p><p>I'm going to assume this is likely an issue with the ElvUI sweep itself requiring a sweep (or something) to function properly, or else it'd already be in.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Freeebo\">Freeebo</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/840\">#840</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/840.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-07-12T05:57:16Z","created_at":"2013-07-12T04:12:24Z","updated_at":"2013-07-12T05:57:16Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That is correct.
