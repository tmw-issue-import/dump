{"issue":{"title":"[CF 67] Can't seem to make TMW to work... ","body":" <p>ATTATCHING A SAVED VARIABLE FILE WILL GET YOUR TICKET ANSWERED 200 TIMES FASTER</p><p>SAVED VARIABLE FILES CAN BE FOUND IN \"World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/&lt;ACOOUNTNAME&gt;/&lt;REALMNAME&gt;/&lt;CHARNAME&gt;/SavedVariables/TellMeWhen. lua\"</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. I have TMW 2.2.3. I'm having trouble getting it to behave as expected, even on simple tasks. I've successfully creating an item for Judgement on my paladin (which is obviously something that's not useful for this addon, but I fell back on trying to get something simple to work). Anyways, the icon shows up and I set it as a cooldown item. Despite this, no matter what options I select, I don't seem to be able to get it to show when it's coming back off cooldown. It's always solid. I've tried buffs and debuffs to the same effect. I've included my config file which should hopefully show what I'm missing . I also tried disabling all my other addons to see of that would make a difference and it did not.</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?<br>The icon never changes state.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?<br>I'm on Cataclysm latest patch. 3.0.3a. Version 2.2.3 of the TMW addon.</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>Nope. It just doesn't seem to function.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.<br>I'm on a Mac if that makes any difference.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/xhugglesx\">xhugglesx</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/67\">#67</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/67.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-26T22:57:34Z","created_at":"2010-12-26T22:41:52Z","updated_at":"2010-12-26T22:58:24Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/126/WoWScrnShot_122610_173717.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"> WoWScrnShot_122610_173717.jpeg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/126/WoWScrnShot_122610_173717.jpeg\" title=\"WoWScrnShot_122610_173717.jpeg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/126/126/126/WoWScrnShot_122610_173717.jpeg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">WoWScrnShot_122610_173717.jpeg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/xhugglesx\">xhugglesx</a>","created_at":"2010-12-26T22:41:52Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/127/TellMeWhen.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen.lua</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/xhugglesx\">xhugglesx</a>","created_at":"2010-12-26T22:41:52Z"},{"body":" <p>Sorry, I forgot to describe the screenshot.
