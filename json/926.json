I will get a closer look at what is going on here when I get home.</del></p>\r\n<p><del>It appears to me that you imported the groups from this profile individually and in an order that is not consistent with the order that they were in in the profile that you imported. When importing a profile, you should always choose the option to import the whole thing all at once instead of importing the groups one by one, as this can cause the links between icons to become broken when importing icons, groups, or profiles that were exported by someone who is using a pre-v7.0.0 version of TellMeWhen. TellMeWhen v7.0.0, which is currently in alpha, has mechanisms to prevent these links from being broken when importing icons and groups individually, but it requires that the source string and the client that is importing the string both be running this version, and this is not the case here. </del></p>\r\n<p><del>Again, I apologize if this is not what has happened here, as I have not yet had a chance to investigate what is happening here first-hand - I am only guessing off what I can tell from this ticket without logging into WoW.

What is happening here is simply that you have meta icons that are trying to check other icons that don't exist (in certain specs), which is exactly what these warnings are there to warn you about. They aren't errors - just warnings that something might be happening that you didn't intend. In this case, there is nothing wrong with this setup, so you can safely disable the warnings.</p>\r\n<p>You can disable these warnings by disabling the \"Warn about invalid icons\" option in TMW's main options.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"02 12 2014 01:06:09 (CDT) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1392188769\">Feb 12, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-02-12T07:04:33Z"},{"body":" <p>Marking ticket as invalid since there is no error here.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-02-12T07:06:32Z"},{"body":" <p>The errrors are me not interesting too, when it going ^^ but it isn´t going.
