{"issue":{"title":"[CF 890] Spell normal hit combat event ","body":" <p>I'm trying to make an icon that shows me when my bloodthirst has been used, but hasn't crit. Now I know how to make combat event icons for both of those conditions separately and I know how to connect those two icons into a single icon that will then have both of those conditions, however I'm worried that those two icons won't update simultaneously and I'll sometimes get false positives, depending on latency. Is there any way to check strictly for a non-critical hit of bloodthirst?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/890\">#890</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/890.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-11-16T19:42:41Z","created_at":"2013-11-16T12:28:54Z","updated_at":"2013-11-16T19:42:41Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Done in d1b1db9</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-11-16T19:42:34Z"}]}
