{"issue":{"title":"[CF 448] Spell queued activation border request ","body":" <p>Hello, thank you for creating a great add-on and I was hoping to make good use of it. Unfortunately I play with a degree of latency.&nbsp; With the standard UI buttons once a spell has been queued a yellow border is displayed, at this point I can move on to clicking the next spell. With a 200 - 250ms delay this is really handy.</p><p>Would it be possible to add this feature?</p><p>For example:</p><p>Prot Warrior. When Revenge procs I would like the Revenge icon to appear, but to behave in appearance like a normal bar button would. Once I have spammed my revenge hotkey and the spell is queued, the yellow spell queued border appears. At this point I can spam my next key.</p><p>Regards.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Slainny\">Slainny</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/448\">#448</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/448.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-02T22:26:15Z","created_at":"2012-02-25T23:23:25Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T22:26:15Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I'm not ruling it out, but I won't make any guarantees either.
