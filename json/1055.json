{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1055] Item count cannot check for numbers &gt; 50 ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create an icon of type \"Spells/Items &gt; Item count (includes charges)\"<br>2. Enter the item to check, e.g. \"Iron Horde Scraps\"<br>3. Select/enter \"200\"</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>TMW should allow me to select or enter the value 200, which is the maximum of Iron Horde Scraps a character can carry.</p><p>Instead, the slider is limited to 50 - this limit was probably set this low because pre-WOD, items could not stack more than 20 times.</p><p>I guess this could be solved in a similar way to the currency check slider: each time the slider hits the right edge, the maximum value is increased (e.g. when creating a check for the apexis crystal maximum of 20,000).</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>7.2.2</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>No.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>-</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/tynstar9\">tynstar9</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1055\">#1055</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1055.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-06T01:31:10Z","created_at":"2015-01-02T10:13:43Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T01:31:10Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
