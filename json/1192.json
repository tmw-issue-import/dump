{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1192] Hide number of charges ","body":" Hello,\r\nIs there a way to hide the number of remaining charges which is displayed by default in TellMeWhen icons?\r\nI am a fire mage and I've recently started using the addon TellMeWhen. I really like it's configurability and the notifications it gives me. However, part of the default setting is to display the number of charges remaining for a particular spell (eg Blast Wave). I realize that information may be helpful sometimes but I'm finding in some cases that having the number displayed is causing me to press the wrong key.\r\nFor example, I've got the \"4\" key bound to Blast Wave and that number is displayed on the Blast Wave button in the action bar at the bottom of my screen. I've placed a TMW Spell Cooldown icon for Blast Wave much closer to the center of the screen but because the number \"2\" (indicating the number of charges left) is commonly present on the TellMeWhen icon, I keep inadvertently pressing the \"2\" key when I want to cast Blast Wave.\r\nI would just as soon get rid of the charge number altogether but I cannot find an option to do so in the TellMeWhen configuration window.\r\nThanks -- and thanks for the fantastic mod! \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/WeThotUWasAToad\">WeThotUWasAToad</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1192\">#1192</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1192.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-02-18T19:06:55Z","created_at":"2016-02-18T03:39:56Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T19:06:55Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Just clear out that text display on the icons text displays (on the main tab of the icon editor)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"02 18 2016 10:38:41 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1455813521\">Feb 18, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-02-18T06:38:48Z"},{"body":" <p>That was easy and should have been obvious to me but I did not equate \"stacks\" with \"charges\".
