{"issue":{"title":"[CF 433] Enable/Disable Icon via Keybind/Command ","body":" <p>It would be nice to be able to bind the state of an icon to a keybind.&nbsp; The reason I want this is there are certain situations where and icon isn't useful and can't be handled with current conditions. For example, if I had a meta icon with a rotation of abilities, but in one specific fight one of those abilities isn't needed. With a hotkey I could disable that icon and the rotational meta icon would precede to skip over it.</p><p>The implementation could be as simple as adding some parameters to the /tmw command that could be put in a macro which can then be bound to a key.<br>For example something along the lines of: /tmw disable GroupName Icon#<br>You could have enable, disable, and toggle keywords for it.</p><p>PS: Thanks for the floating combat text output. That made two less addons needed for me!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/pvtschlag\">pvtschlag</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/433\">#433</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/433.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-02-11T06:55:50Z","created_at":"2012-02-01T23:14:00Z","updated_at":"2012-02-11T06:55:50Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I wouldn't implement actual keybinds, but a macro implementation is definitely possible.</p>\r\n<p>I may also implement conditions that integrate with Big Wigs to check what boss fight you are on.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-02-01T23:41:19Z"},{"body":" <p>Added this functionality in r445.
