{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1335] Track Loot Type Being Run ","body":" I'm running TMW v8.2.2I have a recommendation if at all possible -- doesn't seem too hard to implement. Could you please consider adding a condition to show the loot type being run, like \"Personal\" or \"Group Loot\"? Right now I run an addon called Titan Panel for the sole reason of telling me loot type, but it would be great if Tell Me When had this functionality because it would let me cut down on addon use. Under misc conditions I see a lot of features, but not loot type. Please consider adding it :)))Just if anyone out there happens to know, how do you tell the loot type a group is running w/o an addon? I have used Titan Panel for years and was just wondering how without it folks know what loot type is being run. Does it tell you in chat, is there an icon somewhere?Thanks if you consider adding this feature. \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Monkaddons\">Monkaddons</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1335\">#1335</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1335.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-11-26T20:40:32Z","created_at":"2016-11-02T05:48:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-26T20:40:32Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Loot type is in your player menu (right-click on your portrait).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I don't think I'll add this to TMW, but you can do it easily with a Lua condition:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\n\n```\nGetLootMethod() == \"personalloot\"\n```\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Change the string to one of the values here: <a href=\"http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/GetLootMethod\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/GetLootMethod</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 26 2016 14:39:22 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1480192762\">Nov 26, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-11-26T20:39:09Z"}]}
