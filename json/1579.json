I'd say if they're significant parts of boss fights, then they're worth adding. For example, if the boss applies a 20 second stun to the whole raid during a phase transition, then that isn't significant (because you can't do anything about that). However, if the boss applies an 8 second stun to the tank because you failed a taunt swap mechanic, then that's worth adding.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Back in Cata, there were equiv lists for each tier containing all the significant interruptible spells for that tier (<a href=\"https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/blob/63ce313cef451e76a877f97b577f970636ae0998/TellMeWhen.lua#L1391\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/blob/63ce313cef451e76a877f97b577f970636ae0998/TellMeWhen.lua#L1391</a>). I'd totally be open to bring that concept back, and expand it beyond just spell interrupts. Probably also one for 5 mans since Mythic+ is a thing now. We could have both this AND including things in their respective category (e.g. the stun goes in both Stunned and UldirDebuffs).</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-09-26T17:31:54Z"}]}
