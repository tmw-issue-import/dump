{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1174] Track DoT's that would put a stealth cast back on cooldown ","body":" <p>Would it be possible to track only the debuffs that cause damage over time, perhaps by checking their tooltips for the strings \"damage over X sec\" or \"damage every X sec\" (the addon could also cache the IDs of spells that have these strings, to avoid having to do future tooltip checks on them).</p><p>I already have an Icon to show the cooldown on stealth, but if I could use a meta icon combining that with one that shows how long any DoTs on me are going to last, that would save a lot of stealth casts that just get wasted by a DoT tick, putting stealth back onto cooldown.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/pereidh\">pereidh</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1174\">#1174</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1174.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-17T05:46:18Z","created_at":"2015-11-04T13:44:51Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T05:46:18Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is a bit too specific to warrant a whole new icon type.
