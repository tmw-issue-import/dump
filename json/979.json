{"issue":{"title":"[CF 979] [Beta] Trouble w/Tracking CS Debuff ","body":" <p><a href=\"http://puu.sh/avEGM/cfb1cea3ec.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/avEGM/cfb1cea3ec.jpg</a></p><p>As of the latest beta build, Raging Blow has a new mechanic that when you use it inside a Colossus Smash, it will extend the duration of CS by 2 seconds. It seems that as of this latest change, if you RB in a CS that's duration is under 1 seconds, the timer will cease to work. The aura will still show up that signifies that the target is afflicted by the buff, but the timer breaks.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/979\">#979</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/979.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-07-29T23:05:25Z","created_at":"2014-07-29T07:34:58Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T23:05:25Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That's OmniCC doing that - there is a setting for OmniCC for minimum duration to display text. Its default is 3 seconds.
