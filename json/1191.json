{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1191] Useful CLEU additions for Shadowpriest ","body":" <p>The addition of a \"Non-multistrike Spell Damage\" event and a \"Non-Multistrike Periodic Spell Damage Crit\" event would be very useful for Shadowpriests trying to track the number of shadowy apparitions they have out.</p><p>I've actually got it working right now but I had to go into the cleu.lua and create those two \"dummy\" events (much like the spell damage crit one added for fire mages) so the changes would have to be added every time the addon updated.</p><p>I realize that these events are pretty specific so if adding those events into TMW proper is impractical, is there a way I can accomplish this with a lua snippet?&nbsp; I'm not looking for the exact code to use, just whether or not it's possible.</p><p>(In case you're wondering, the reason for the non-multistrike is Shadowy Apparitions do not proc if the SW:P crit was a multistrike crit and there's no other way to track when one spawns.&nbsp; Same thing for when a Shadowy Apparition does damage.&nbsp; I use that event to drop my counter by 1 but if it multistrikes, it drops by 2.)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Raxle\">Raxle</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1191\">#1191</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1191.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T22:55:10Z","created_at":"2016-02-16T00:10:19Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T22:55:10Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Multistrike is gone in Legion.
