{"issue":{"title":"[CF 221] Position updates ","body":" <p>I have a icon group anchored to each party/raid frame which are moving dynamically upwards with party size, but with me on top. Right now I have to open the options to update the position of the TMW-groups each time the party size changes. What I wish for is that the the position of TMW are updated on a regular basis without having to open the options.</p><p>I don't know if this is possible or can be done in an efficient way without having to load the options, I just hope :) Thank you.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Catok\">Catok</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/221\">#221</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/221.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-06-11T21:12:03Z","created_at":"2011-06-05T11:43:01Z","updated_at":"2011-06-11T21:12:03Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Could you attach your saved variables and a few screenshots?

When it does, TMW doesn't catch that the frames appear. </p>\r\n<p>I said initially that I needed to open the options, however a group lock toggle is what is needed. The problem is that I usually forget to do so and get all confused with the displacement of the icons :(<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/BB4PrNqk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Savedvariables</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Catok\">Catok</a>","created_at":"2011-06-06T13:40:04Z"},{"body":" <p>Try r111 and let me know if it solves the problem.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-06-06T23:35:43Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks for the update.

P2 stays centered on the screen until I do another toggle.</p>\r\n<p>So I basically still have to \"initialize\" the anchors manually.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Catok\">Catok</a>","created_at":"2011-06-07T19:38:32Z"},{"body":" <p>Alright, tested and fixed with anchoring to VuhDo party frames in r113.
