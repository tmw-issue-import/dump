Didn't think to test it in the first place because the icon I needed it for was a Buff/Debuff Check icon and I thought that if several buffs were listed, it would go off if ANY one of them is absent. But in reality it goes off only if ALL of them are absent and doesn't go off if one of the listed buffs is present, which is just what I needed.
