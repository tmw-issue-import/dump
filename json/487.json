{"issue":{"title":"[CF 487] Mindcontrol debuff icon not properly finishing ","body":" <p>I use an icon to show me when I get crowd controlled, similar to the addon Loosecontrol. Mind control is one of those crowd controls. However when I'm on my priest and mind control another player that icon also fires. Now even though this might not be quite the way it's intended, I don't mind it at all. After all a mind control cast by myself also kinda cc's myself. However once the mind control ends, for whatever reason, the icon doesn't go away. It always finishes its 8 second duration first, even though mind control might have ended 4 seconds ago.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/487\">#487</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/487.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-02T07:17:00Z","created_at":"2012-04-27T00:53:11Z","updated_at":"2012-09-02T07:17:00Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Sounds like an event is firing at the wrong time, or isn't firing at all.

However the only way to cancel mind control in duels is with the trinket or voluntary cancels. In arena there are also interrupts and stuns etc. Given the fact that (apart from Seduction) Mind Control is the only channeled cc maybe those are events TellMeWhen doesn't check for?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-05-03T16:23:00Z"},{"body":" <p>Well, UNIT_AURA should fire whenever someone's buffs/debuffs change, regardless of what caused the change. It if isn't, then that is Blizzard's problem, but it is still something that I have to work around. I just don't know what the actual cause is or I would be able to fix this. I could take the atomic bomb approach and just disable the event driver for buff/debuff icons entirely, but nukes are usually a bad idea.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-03T21:34:41Z"},{"body":" <p>Does this still happen?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-26T11:41:37Z"},{"body":" <p>Closing ticket.
