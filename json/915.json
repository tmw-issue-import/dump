{"issue":{"title":"[CF 915] Problem With Events and GCD ","body":" <p>I'm Currently Trying to Setup a&nbsp; tell me when Sound Event to notify me when a spell finishes its CD (Incarnation or Innervate for Example). Though i have managed to do so, the problem is that when the spell becomes available (aka finishes it CD) and is shown, every time i cast a spell that enters the GCD, the icons is hidden and subsequently shown after the GCD is done therefore, each time it makes a sound. I'm constantly hearing the ping sound and have found no way to ignore the GCD.</p><p>An example String for Incarnation:</p><p>^1^T^SDurationMin^N3 ^SType^Scooldown ^SName^SIncarnation ^SClockGCD^B ^SUnAlpha^N0.91 ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SSound ^SSound^STMW~`-~`Pling~`4 ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SEnabled^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SName^S[Duration(gcd=false)] ^t^t^t^N62602^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Setup any spell with a cool down as above.<br>2. When the Spell finishes its 3 min cd, the event (in this case a sound alert) occurs.<br>3. Everytime I cast a spell, the icon is hidden and a second afters appears with it's event. I other words I hear a ping every second.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>I wish for the event to occur when the spell finishes its CD and only that once. Not every time<br>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
