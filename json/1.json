{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1] Pet spell cooldowns bug when pet is dismissed/dies. ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?</p><p>1. Summon a controllable Death Knight Ghoul Pet<br>2. Set TellMeWhen to track the Cooldown of a Pet's spell (\"Gnaw\" in my example)<br>3. Let the pet die or dismiss it.<br>4. TellMeWhen gets confused because the spell is no longer available in the spellbook to track.</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</p><p>I would expect TellMeWhen to temporarily stop tracking the pet's spell cooldowns when no pet is existant. Instead I received the error message below and the spell cooldown \"button\" stopped working completely until the next /console reloadui.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?</p><p>TellMeWhen 1.1</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>TellMeWhen.lua:413: attempt to compare number with nil</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>I assume this happens with any pet spell that has a cooldown to track.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/clesch\">clesch</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1\">#1</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-03-13T19:52:46Z","created_at":"2009-01-16T09:10:33Z","updated_at":"2010-03-13T19:52:46Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
