While this probably is not the best method to do this, you could create a cooldown icon, using the spellID of lifeblood as the cooldown to track, and set it to always show. Keep the timer and mana/range check options off, of course.</p>\r\n<p>I think I will add an icon type that allows you to specify a custom texture/solid color, the only purpose of which is to check conditions.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-04-14T21:37:47Z"},{"body":" <p>I saw the new icon type.
