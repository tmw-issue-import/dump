{"issue":{"title":"[CF 633] Debuff brightness behaves strangely when \"Show absent\" selected ","body":" <p>TMW v. 6.0.3; all other AddOns temporarily disabled.</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^Starget ^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SShadowflame ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STexts^T ^N2^S ^t^t^t^SShowWhen^N3 ^SCustomTex^S47960 ^SUnAlpha^N0.25 ^SEnabled^B ^t^N60345^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>This example uses the Demo Warlock Shadowflame dot, but any debuff will do it. Basically, if I create an icon to monitor a Debuff, tell it to show when Present and Absent, and disable the \"Show timer\" option (ie, cooldown clock)... something odd happens.</p><p>The debuff, when present, will appear at severely reduced brightness (but full opacity). Disabling \"Show when Absent\" will cause the debuff's brightness to return to full when it's present.&nbsp; Enabling \"Show timer\" will cause the bright portion of the clock to show at full brightness when present. But selecting both \"Show when Absent\" and \"Don't show timer\" will cause the icon to be severely darkened when the debuff is present.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Lov3star\">Lov3star</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/633\">#633</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/633.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-19T19:34:41Z","created_at":"2012-09-19T12:06:25Z","updated_at":"2012-09-19T19:34:41Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Working as intented/as configured.</p>\r\n<p>Pay a visit to the buff/debuff color settings in TMW's main options.
