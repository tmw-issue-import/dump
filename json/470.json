{"issue":{"title":"[CF 470] Option to invert meta-icon ","body":" <p>Please consider adding an option for meta-icon to invert its state (show when it should be hidden and hide when it should be visible).</p><p>For example, I need to show meta-icon only when none of the two other icons are visible.</p><p>Example as a hunter: show Cobra shot icon when BOTH Explosive shot and Black arrow are NOT available.</p><p>If I add a meta-icon for both Cobra shot and Black arrow then this icon is shown when either or both of the ablilities are available. The opposite is needed - show when neither of the abilities are available.</p><p>This is also useful for frost mage rotation and maybe other specs and classes as well.</p><p>Thank you.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/algus2\">algus2</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/470\">#470</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/470.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-03-17T18:14:45Z","created_at":"2012-03-17T16:39:33Z","updated_at":"2012-03-17T18:14:45Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You can use Icon Shown conditions (or other conditions, actually) to accomplish this quite easily. Create an icon for Cobra Shot, and add either 2 \"Spell cooldown\" conditions to check if BA and ES are on cooldown, or add 2 \"Icon Shown\" conditions to check if icons for ES and BA are shown or not.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"03 17 2012 13:14:07 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1332008047\">Mar 17, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-03-17T18:13:35Z"},{"body":" <p><code>^1^T^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SSPELLCD ^SOperator^S~|= ^SName^SBlack~`Arrow ^t^N2^T ^SType^SSPELLCD ^SOperator^S~|= ^SName^SExplosive~`Shot ^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SType^Scooldown ^SEnabled^B ^SName^SCobra~`Shot ^t^N50304^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-03-17T18:14:33Z"}]}
