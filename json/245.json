{"issue":{"title":"[CF 245] Editing the duration on the icons ","body":" <p>It would be good if there were a way to edit the duration that is displayed on the icons. I'd like to place it and resize it to a smaller size than the icon itself so it can be displayed below the spell. This will enable me to clearly see the stack size. I looked through the options and could only find ways to move the stack size and not the duration.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BGR1\">BGR1</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/245\">#245</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/245.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-06-30T08:17:27Z","created_at":"2011-06-30T06:39:35Z","updated_at":"2011-06-30T08:17:27Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is handled in OmniCC, not TMW.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-06-30T07:41:34Z"},{"body":" <p>I reinstalled OmniCC and cleared variables the text went away. Your solution fixed the issue. It was an OmniCC thing, although it would be great if this functionality were part of TellMeWhen so one wouldn't need to create several rules for separate groups.
