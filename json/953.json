{"issue":{"title":"[CF 953] Masque Coloring ","body":" <p>Very Low Priority</p><p>Problem with masque coloring for a certain masque skin with tellmewhen. The border should be greyish. Some are grey and some are black. It only happens with this border that I have noticed, but it is the one I like. I understand you might say well its probably the skin then. I have looked into it a little, but it doesn't have a coloring problem with any other addons. ex Dominoes, Blizzard Buffs, Hermes, Raven. So who knows.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Addons: TMW, Masque, Masque: Renaitre (Renaitre: Square Thin)<br>2. More TMW bars give you a higher probability of failure of skin</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?

If I copy the icon some where else, it can be skinned the right way. so it doesn't stay the same. It seems more to do with a group if it is not skinning right. When I do /tmw, the group with a black border icon turns black on all the icons in that group. When I switch out of config mode, it goes back to the screen shot.</p>\r\n<p>Also one group is not being skinned at all. I can post the export string, but it happens over many characters so I didn't.</p>\r\n<p>Adding 2 more screen shots.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Shaft840\">Shaft840</a>","created_at":"2014-06-18T13:21:05Z"},{"body":" <p>Its your Masque configuration. The \"Normal\" color setting for some groups is different than it is for other groups. The reason that you are seeing different colors within each group is because meta icons are inherit that color ( you can see this in the group to the right of your player unit frame).</p>\r\n<p>Type /masque and then go and change the \"Normal\" color for all of TellMeWhen. For the group that isn't skinned, I suspect that it has been explicitly disabled.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-06-19T04:23:49Z"},{"body":" <p>You are right. The meta inheritance threw me off to looking hard through the setup. I used global settings for masque, but sadly it didn't do it to all the subgroups right. Sorry to waist your time :(.
