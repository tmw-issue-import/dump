How should it look and feel?</p><p>Is there some way to get a single box to track both Shadow Infusion and Dark Transformation on an Unholy DK's ghoul pet?</p><p>I can get it to track Shadow Infusion timer/stacks correctly, but it would be nice if that same box automatically shifted to a Dark Transformation timer so that I can begin storing RP to dump once it's about to revert.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mtrixis\">mtrixis</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/70\">#70</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/70.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-29T13:32:26Z","created_at":"2010-12-29T13:30:29Z","updated_at":"2010-12-29T13:32:37Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Nevermind, figured it out!
