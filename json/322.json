I figured that after that, people probably know how resetting an icon works and don't need to be spammed.</p>\r\n<p>Do you think that I should remove this feature? I hate the spam people's chat every time they reset an icon, but I also don't want to leave people wondering why their icon won't reset.</p>\r\n<p>What I have considered doing is removing this feature, and instead have a restore button appear. It would probably be a dropdown that contains a list of icons (or more specifically, icon data) from that icon slot that were reset since the last login/reload. Or maybe I will include every single change made to that icon since logging in, but that would be a little harder as far as implementation goes. But cooler. And more useful.</p>\r\n<p>I don't have anything happening this weekend, so I will figure something out.</p>\r\n<p>(I think I just made a mountain out of a molehill.)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-10-28T21:53:34Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20322%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20322%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>Move RESET_NOTIFY and RESET_EXPIRE to reset button mouseover tooltip, when people reset failed use TMW.HELP to show someting warning reset is timeout and how to reset (everytime), i think nobody will click reset button to see that only they are boring.</p>\r\n<p>Keep every singe change list is so cool ! <br>\r\nIf only need backup for reset icons: add the last 10 or 20 icons of reset, before reset the icon, add that icon to that \"reset icon list\", if number &gt; 10 or &gt;20 then delete icon order by date and time.</p>\r\n<p><span>:D</span> </p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"10 28 2011 21:13:07 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1319854387\">Oct 28, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lsjyzjl\">lsjyzjl</a>","created_at":"2011-10-29T01:54:54Z"},{"body":" <p>I already started work on an undo/redo feature that can be used for every setting modification.

The old method involved completely loading the group condition frame and the icon condition frame (which are technically the same frame, they just get re-purposed depending on which you are looking at). Blizzard's dropdown menu code is horribly inefficient, so resetting and then setting all of the condition type dropdowns was causing a noticeable FPS loss.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that is also an issue is that it records almost too many changes. Changing a condition value slider with the mouse wheel will put every single change in value into the queue because of the way it is saved and the way that the undo engine looks for changes. I will probably just put a timer on it - something like an interval of 1 second to check for changes made to the settings.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-10-29T18:42:14Z"},{"body":" <p>What I need to do is create an actual default condition that doesn't do anything, similar to the default icon type.
