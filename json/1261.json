It would either require way more input from the user, or a substantial effort from me to keep some list of all such spells and rules around their cooldowns. There are also lots of cases where the rule isn't as simple as that, e.g. the cooldown of X is reduced by Y every time you cast Z.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(I realize this ticket is 2 years old.
