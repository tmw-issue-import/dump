{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1386] Guardian duration priority ","body":" <p>Currently the Guardians icon type shows the longest duration guardian alive. &nbsp;As a Demo lock, if you have imps out, and summon a new set of imps, the timer on that icon will reset to showing the duration of the new imps.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It would be nice if we had the same duration priority selection options available on meta icons and buff/debuff icons, so we could have it show us&nbsp;<em>either</em> highest or lowest duration at our preference. &nbsp;Specific to a Demo lock, it's often more useful information for us to know how long we have left until our soonest-expiring&nbsp;demons expire rather than the most recent set of demons, since we need that information to evaluate whether we have time to complete a Thal'kiel's Consumption cast before they expire.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Kaedys\">Kaedys</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1386\">#1386</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1386.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-08-12T04:45:35Z","created_at":"2017-02-23T19:54:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-12T09:30:27Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>+1</p>\r\n<p>Came in here to say exactly this. &nbsp;Showing a timer for the oldest set of guardians would definitely be more appropriate, but giving an option to choose would of course be best.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/meltra\">meltra</a>","created_at":"2017-03-12T17:41:01Z"},{"body":" <p>The suggested usage of this icon type is as a group controller - that way, you will see all of your guardians' durations.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-03-22T02:08:23Z"},{"body":" <p>Yes, but if we just want ONE icon for our guardians, it would be beneficial for the icon to have and respect the duration priority options. &nbsp;I don't really have the screen real estate where by TMW bars are to have an entire group just for the guardians. &nbsp;I just need an icon that indicates how long I have on the soonest-to-expire set of them.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"04 25 2017 23:15:19 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1493180119\">Apr 25, 2017</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Kaedys\">Kaedys</a>","created_at":"2017-04-26T04:14:12Z"},{"body":" <p>&lt;3</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Kaedys\">Kaedys</a>","created_at":"2017-08-12T09:30:27Z"}]}
