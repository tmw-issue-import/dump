How should it look and feel?</p><p>When I set a cooldown spell icon to a) 'always show' with say a 50% alpha when unusable AND b) have power check enabled, it actually goes completely invisible if no power.</p><p>I would like the icon when it is on CD and has insufficient power to still stay visible albeit dimmed at the 50% alpha. Can you help?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mantooth555\">Mantooth555</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/75\">#75</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/75.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-31T05:32:58Z","created_at":"2010-12-30T07:05:35Z","updated_at":"2010-12-31T05:32:58Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You have your settings set to completely hide an icon when you have no power.
