{"issue":{"title":"[CF 423] Default for meta icons sorted by high duration ","body":" <p>When none of the icons in a meta icon sorted by high duration are displaying a timer to compare, the metaicon doesn't show anything. Wouldn't it be better to let the meta icon default to the normal prioritization when that happens? Sorting by low duration already yields these results.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/423\">#423</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/423.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-01-15T22:42:23Z","created_at":"2012-01-15T04:06:13Z","updated_at":"2012-01-15T22:42:23Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>If it looks like a bug, swims like a bug, and quacks like a bug, then it probably is a bug.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-15T05:04:24Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20423%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20423%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>I just experienced another related bug with a meta icon sorted by low duration.
