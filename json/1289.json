{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1289] Possible to create a onetime timer when a combat begins? ","body":" <p>Hi first of all,</p><p>i wanted to ask if it´s possible to create an icon which starts a predefined timer every time a fight begins/i´m in a combat and it only restarts after i´m out of combat.<br>I tried to use the combat event icon type,where you can set a timer, but there is not an existing event like \"combat start\". I used the \"unit in combat\" as condition but either its refreshing instantly or after my timer is done,depends if i enable the \"dont refresh\" setting.<br>Besides i dont event know what to use in the \"what to track\"-field.</p><p>Is there a possibility to implement this kind function?</p><p>Regards<br>Mindfork</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1289\">#1289</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1289.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-09-05T00:48:40Z","created_at":"2016-09-03T14:27:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T00:48:40Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That only takes a second to make so I made it for you.

Lets take e.g. 8seconds. The icon should be shown if i come into combat by any source,a player is hitting me or a sb hits a boss in a raid... . If i´m in combat the timer should count backwards from 8 to 0. If it reaches 0 it should stop counting and not be refreshed while im still in combat.\r\nThe timer/icon should reset if i went out of combat like death or bossfight ends and restart if i come back into combat.\r\nIt seems like to be working with the \"timer DogTag\" but i have no idea how to use this.\r\nRegards\r\nMindfork</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-09-04T11:44:47Z"},{"body":" <p>Delete the group I sent you. Then import this one. I had the same issue as you so I made a quick workaround. I believe TMW displays these timers through the omniCC addon for me.
