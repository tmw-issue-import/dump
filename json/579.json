Just create a new group and add all 4 debuffs as separate icons (which I believe you already did.) Then go to group settings/Icon sorting and choose \"Shown (Respect Always Hide)\" instead of \"Icon ID\". The high/low duration checkbox will then control if the group is growing left to right or right to left.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-09-04T20:50:15Z"},{"body":" <p>Oh.
