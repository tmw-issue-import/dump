{"issue":{"title":"[CF 893] Global Groups do not Export (7.0.0 Alpha) ","body":" <p>I was giving my export string to a friend who also had the 7.0.0 alpha, and none of the global groups carried over to the import.

Export them individually if they are essential to the function of the profile. I will consider adding an export option to put all global groups into one string, but I'm still not entirely sure if I want to do that or not.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-12-03T20:18:00Z"}]}
