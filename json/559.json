{"issue":{"title":"[CF 559] Command Demon ","body":" <p>Command Demon doesnt appear to be working correctly.

It transformed once when I summoned an imp the very first time after logging in, and having the icon as a multi-state cooldown worked, but the spell itself seems bugged.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-30T07:16:55Z"},{"body":" <p>Well, the spell seems to work if I mount up, fly in the air, and then land again.
