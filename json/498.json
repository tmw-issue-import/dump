{"issue":{"title":"[CF 498] Meta icons not using component borders r512 ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>&nbsp; Using a meta with 2 components, one of the components using a border with different colors according to current stacks, the other component icon has an activation border flash (Monitors legendary dagger stacks then shows the duration of the proc)</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>&nbsp; The meta to show the border according to its components<br>&nbsp; It worked like this before the last major update, now it seems to ignore them. The stacks of the first/duration of the second show correctly but not the border animations.</p><p>&nbsp; I have another group similar to this that works intermittently (<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/5dK0rX2z\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/5dK0rX2z</a>)<br>&nbsp; This one has 2 components as well- One is a continually flashing red border, the other is a 1second icon shake on a combat log event. This gives me a red-flashing Blade Flurry icon which jiggles/hides the red border for 1second every time blade flurry hits something so I can tell when its being effective.<br></p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
