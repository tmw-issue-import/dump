{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1271] Unit range condition failure. ","body":" <p>Hi. My friend has a sort of issue. \"Unit range\" condition works only with hostile targets. So if we set party1 or partymember name or just target (if target is not an enemy) as an object - the icone doesnt work. Doesnt seems like its possible to reproduce since it works fine for me. We tried to delete WTF, Interface and Cache folders and was testing only with tellmewhen enabled on a clean profile. No errors. Just doesnt work, as on beta as on live either. Version 8.1.2-2-g0a19738. Absolutely no ideas what to do.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ckotuna\">Ckotuna</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1271\">#1271</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1271.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-08-14T19:36:19Z","created_at":"2016-08-09T18:26:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-14T19:36:19Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Works fine for me.
