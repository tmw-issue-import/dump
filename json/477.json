{"issue":{"title":"[CF 477] 2x Landslide Proc ","body":" <p>Hey guys ty for this amassing add-on.<br>I have a bit of problem with 2 procs at the same time of Landslide. I am a rogue with landslide on both weapons...<br>Yes i can easily track one proc of Landslide, but i don't know how to make it show that there are 2 procs(buffs) at the same time (they may even have the same ID, can we check whats the source of a certin buf? like MH/OH?). Can it show a stack number? (there are separate procs)</p><p>Anyways I am very sorry if this can already be tracked with the addon and please give me an exemple.<br>THank you in advance!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/MareleADI\">MareleADI</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/477\">#477</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/477.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-03-31T05:02:38Z","created_at":"2012-03-30T09:58:05Z","updated_at":"2012-03-31T05:02:38Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I wrote up some instructions on how to do this a while back, but I forgot to post them in the forums.
