{"issue":{"title":"[CF 587] icon issue ","body":" <p>I set an icon to monitor corruption and another for immolate<br>when I changed spec from affliction to destruction, when there was an immolate on the target, not only icon for immolate was shown but also the icon for corruption was shown (this icon shown in immolate as well) and I was definitely sure that I did not add immolate into corruption icon.</p><p>then I figured out that the reason for this could be that in the MOP, spells of different spec would be changed automatically when you swap specs, e.g. you can make a macro that /cast shadow bolt under destruction but it will automatically cast an incinerate for you.</p><p>any solution for this, thanks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/a1204350\">a1204350</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/587\">#587</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/587.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-04T20:53:41Z","created_at":"2012-09-04T12:57:32Z","updated_at":"2012-09-04T20:53:41Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Please do not ignore the default ticket template.
