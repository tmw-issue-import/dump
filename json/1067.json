{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1067] Overview page, ","body":" <p>I miss an way to check while /tmw is active, what icon is actually appearing in a meta icon. this would be incredibly handy for troubleshooting.

There are only 3 tabs that configure icons, and they all present their information quite plainly. The only things that isn't immediately accessible are Unit Conditions/ Notification trigger conditions, and those only need one extra button press.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-01-12T04:10:53Z"}]}
