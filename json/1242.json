{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1242] Add ability to control dimensions of bars ","body":" <p>I started using progress bars and vertical bars, but one thing that makes them less ideal for me is that I can't customize their sizes at all, other than scale.</p><p>Specifically - bars are wider than I'd like. I currently hack around it a little by using large transparent bar borders but clearly that's not how it's supposed to be used, and also not very robust.</p><p>Thanks for an awesome addon!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1242\">#1242</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1242.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-08-09T05:30:22Z","created_at":"2016-07-23T09:54:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T05:30:22Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/117/Capture.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"> Capture.PNG</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/117/Capture.PNG\" title=\"Capture.PNG\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/117/126/126/Capture.PNG\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">Capture.PNG</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a>","created_at":"2016-07-23T09:54:32Z"},{"body":" <p>Is changing the scale and the length not functionally equivalent to changing the length and width?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-23T19:23:35Z"},{"body":" <p>Wait...
