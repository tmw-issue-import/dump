{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1598] Is there a clean way to achieve this? ","body":" <p>I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to ask for help but I also don't know where else to ask!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm trying to setup an icon that shows the remaining cooldown on any ability that fails a cast over x seconds, preferably.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example, if I'm casting revival and revival has 50 seconds left, an icon shows in the center of the screen showing revival icon and 50sec timer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At the moment the only way I can think to do it is to make 2 icons for every ability I want to show; one for the failed combat event and one for the ability cooldown, then use a meta icon to display any ability cooldowns currently shown. This is potentially a huge amount of work depending on the number of abilities; is there a cleaner way about going to set it up? For example&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"Combat Event &gt; if spell \"x\" fails, show icon for \"x\" while timer is running, with cooldown duration of \"x\". I tried to do so using the duration tag but I can't even get it to work on a specific ability that way, let alone a generic catchall.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/user_976011\">user_976011</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1598\">#1598</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1598.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-10-21T02:19:18Z","created_at":"2018-10-21T01:55:18Z","updated_at":"2018-10-21T02:19:18Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That's a bit too far off the beaten path for TMW to be able to do.
