{"issue":{"title":"[CF 79] New Mechanics - DOT ","body":" <p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>DOT's have a new mechanic. I used Tell Me When before as an affliction lock to know when to recast a DoT. The dot would expire, and I would know I needed to recast it because I had set the icon (say \"Curse of Agony\") to appear when the debuff was absent on the boss. It was perfect because you would never clip a dot. Waiting for expiration was best.</p><p>Now, though, this has changed. Dot's cannot be clipped, and it's now ideal to refresh them between the second to last and last tick, and it's a DPS loss to wait for the DoT to be expired. This means that to work for DoT's, Tell me when would need to have an option where the icon would appear, for example, with the condition that there only remains 3 seconds (this needs to be modifiable) to the debuff.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Aleks1975\">Aleks1975</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/79\">#79</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/79.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-01-02T17:07:06Z","created_at":"2011-01-02T03:30:00Z","updated_at":"2011-01-02T20:59:41Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Have you bothered to download the latest version?
