{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1035] Shroud of Con - timer ","body":" <p>Hi, I was wondering if you were able to assist me to get Shroud of Concealment timer working.</p><p>I'm not a rogue, but I plan on doing 2's with a rogue, and when he pops Shroud of Concealment, I use Tell Me When to track it.</p><p>Even though I click the timer option, when the rogue pops SoC, TMW does track it, but the timer won't work, so it's only ever either on or off.</p><p>I'd like to try and get the timer working so I can tell how long it has to go before the SoC dissipates.</p><p>Is there anyway to track SoC with the timer on myself?</p><p>Was thinking, if it possibly bypasses the issue, should I be tracking it on the actual rogue that pops it? That would help me in arena with my rogue partner, but not for bg's and stuff in general.</p><p>Any help / assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/icehawk15\">icehawk15</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1035\">#1035</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1035.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-11-24T01:26:12Z","created_at":"2014-11-24T01:24:51Z","updated_at":"2014-11-24T09:03:34Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Please don't ignore the ticket template.
