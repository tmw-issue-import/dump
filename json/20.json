{"issue":{"title":"[CF 20] Tree of Life cooldown tracking problem ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create a TellMeWhen button to track Tree of Life<br>2. Use Tree of Life<br>3. Watch as the button not reacts at all to the cooldown triggering.</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?<br>I was hoping to have a button to track when Tree of Life is available.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?<br>1.4.2</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>Don't get an error</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.<br>I realise this problem in all probability comes from me not entering the right spell ID, but so far I've tried all instances of spell ID's from Wowhead.com (5420, 81098, 81097, 48371 and 53691) and tried just using the Spell Name, Tree of Life. Using the spell does not trigger the 3 min CD to show up on the button in any of these cases.<br>The options assigned to the button are: Enable Icon, Icon Type - Cooldown, Show Timer, Cooldown Type - Spell or Ability, Show Icon When - Always, Unit Reaction - All Units, Bars - Show cooldown/timer bar (big thanks for this feature btw. I am colorblind and it really helps).</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Archont1978\">Archont1978</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/20\">#20</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/20.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-10-23T23:36:29Z","created_at":"2010-10-18T14:23:12Z","updated_at":"2010-10-23T23:36:29Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This works correctly for me using the settings you provided me.
