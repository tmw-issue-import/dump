The other was to have it defined right next to the spell in the editbox; something like:</p>\r\n<p>\"Killshot:10; Kill Command:6; Rapid Fire:3:00; Rapid Fire:180\"</p>\r\n<p>The only problem with this that I see is getting users to actually know how to do this. Maybe I will do a tutorial sort of thing where a big window pops up when the choose a unit cooldown icon for the first time that tells them how to use it.</p>\r\n<p>The only problem with my first idea (yours) is that it would really have to be in its own tab in order to not be clunky (need to have a scrollbar, and need to be able to see more than a few rows at a time) - but having a separate tab for it would be clunky anyway.</p>\r\n<p>Actually, I had a third idea too, but this one just won't work well at all. That idea was to parse the tooltip of the spell entered to get the cooldown length (I should do this as an extension of the suggestion list), but that won't really work for spells entered as names, or spells that have their cooldowns reduced by talents.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-06-10T04:44:11Z"},{"body":" <p>idea1 idea3 is easiest for use(don't need too much help)</p>\r\n<p>idea2 is good idea, but need join the unit for watch,if don't have this, it's still need one more icon to track the same spells. <br>\r\none example:<br>\r\nStunedSpell1:area1:10; StunedSpell1:area2:10<br>\r\nAND NEED ONE BIGGGGG HELP BUTTON ON ANYWHERE(click to show a tutorial),Only seen once is not enough!</p>\r\n<p>By The Way, I knew about 70% player can't insert custom unit like : \"boss1target\", \"focustargettarget\", they only choice the predefined set unit, is this a problem?-.-</p>\r\n<p>Idea4:it's looks like merge 1&amp;2 idea.<br>\r\nAdd two button(add/update)behind the three textbox, if click add button will add the Spell/Unit/Duration to a dropdown menu index.Add two&nbsp;&nbsp;button behind the Dropdown menu(modify/remove).</p>\r\n<p>[SPELL] [UNIT] [DURATION]&nbsp;&nbsp;[ADD]or[Update]<br>\r\n[Dropdown&nbsp;&nbsp;Menu]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Modify][Remove]</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"06 10 2011 02:45:27 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1307691927\">Jun 10, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lsjyzjl\">lsjyzjl</a>","created_at":"2011-06-10T06:50:33Z"},{"body":" <p><em>idea2 is good idea, but need join the unit for watch,if don't have this, it's still need one more icon to track the same spells. </em></p>\r\n<p>You will still be able to enter multiple units to be checked in the unit editbox with idea2.</p>\r\n<p><em>By The Way, I knew about 70% player can't insert custom unit like : \"boss1target\", \"focustargettarget\", they only choice the predefined set unit, is this a problem?-.-</em></p>\r\n<p>I suppose I should direct people to WowPedia's page about UnitIDs in the tooltip if they want/need more information.
