{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1119] Severe FPS Lag - Unit Threat - Scaled ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Similarly, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Backup\". Select the \"To string\" option for the appropriate export type for your issue, and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Make an icon with a threat condition tracking a specific target.<br>2.<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>No lag when leaving configuration mode tracking threat on a specific unit. Severe lag when you leave configuration mode tracking a specific unit.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>v7.3.1</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>No.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>I turned off every addon except TMW to isolate and the lag persists. Seems to happen if you just input a specific unit in the unit threat condition. Also lags if you don't input any unit at all. Perhaps I'm just going about this icon the wrong way. What I wanted was to have TMW have these conditions: Show if 2 stacks of Inferno Slice is on my focus target, and am not tanking Gruul. If I attempt to add the 2nd condition it just makes me lag terribly. I feel like I can't make TMW tanking icons without being able to track threat which is what's making me lag. =/</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SStackMinEnabled^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^STHREATSCALED ^SUnit^Sfocustarget ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SStackMin^N2 ^SName^SInferno~`Slice ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^STMW:textlayout:1IrhfjmBA68d ^STexts^T ^N1^STaunt! ^t^t^t^SCustomTex^S155080 ^SUnit^Sfocus ^SGUID^STMW:icon:1LMjKw69Yg3d ^SEnabled^B ^SFakeHidden^B ^t^N73101^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>^1 ^T^N1^T ^SAnchors^T ^N1^T ^Sx^N1 ^t^t^SOutline^SOUTLINE ^SName^S2002 ^SStringName^SInfo ^SSize^N7 ^t^N2^T ^SAnchors^T ^N1^T ^Sy^N30 ^t^t^SStringName^STitle ^t^SGUID^STMW:textlayout:1IrhfjmBA68d ^Sn^N2 ^SName^SDefault~`Icon ^t^N73101^S~`~| ^Stextlayout^STMW:textlayout:1IrhfjmBA68d ^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/felrece\">felrece</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1119\">#1119</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1119.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-05-25T19:53:38Z","created_at":"2015-05-19T09:29:15Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T07:32:13Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Please enable Lua errors before submitting bug reports of this nature.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-05-25T19:42:23Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201119%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201119%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>Sorry Cybeloras.
