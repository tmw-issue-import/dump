{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1351] Preview Icon / Scale Text to Icon Size ","body":" <p>1) Being able to preview an icon would be a really nice way to see how it looks without having to set it up as something that is easily triggered to see in real time. For example a slash command would be an easy way to do it (like /tmw preview group X icon y).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2) An option to scale the text to the icon size. Sometimes the default texts are WAY bigger than the icon, and force you to clone them to make them fit. Kind of goes hand in hand with wanting to be able to preview, so I can see text size and any notification colors and whatnot.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1351\">#1351</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1351.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-04-01T23:44:38Z","created_at":"2016-12-03T08:26:24Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T23:44:38Z","labels":["declined","enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Additionally, having an option to 'scale' the text size on an icon-per-icon basis at the text display area would also alleviate the second option, and probably do better in certain cases of putting custom made text layouts on bigger icons that were originally made for small ones, to save you making an entirely new layout.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"12 3 2016 02:34:22 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1480754062\">Dec 3, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2016-12-03T08:33:26Z"},{"body":" <p>The closest you'll ever get to a preview like that is the way the icon looks like in config mode.
