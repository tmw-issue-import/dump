{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1027] Icon of doom doesn't show ","body":" <p>Hello, I'm a player of CWOW and I enjoy using TellMeWhen to help me. But as a demonology warlock, I find that the icon of doom (Metamorphosis version of corruption) can't be shown normally before I used it once. In every test, after I use doom once, it can monitor the Debuff normally with correct icon shown, but before I use doom a clock icon is shown instead.<br>The servers are in maintainence at this moment, and I'll attach the screen shot along with the string as soon as possible</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ethereal64\">ethereal64</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1027\">#1027</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1027.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-11-20T21:45:21Z","created_at":"2014-11-16T06:56:02Z","updated_at":"2014-11-20T21:45:21Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is normal - if a spell is tracked by name and it is not in your spellbook, TellMeWhen can't figure out what texture to use.</p>\r\n<p>You can fix this by either tracking the spell by its spellID, or you can set a custom texture on the icon (which is the easier option, because if you track by spellID then you need to be 100% sure that you are using the correct ID).</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-11-16T07:36:30Z"}]}
