I got dced in arena, and now its not working at all. First time I installed it I didnt need to configurate anything, it just worked perfectly as I wanted it to be. (showing my debuffs in the middle of my screen, whatever it was.)\r\nIf I am in a kidney-shot, it appeared in my screen and the timer of it. If one of my teammates was in a smokebomb it showed up in the middle of my screen. That's the thing I want back, things like that not only the few I mentioned. </p>\r\n<p>Now after my DC in arena nothing is working... I tried to reinstall, other versions and delete the tellmewhen options inside the \"WTF\" -folder. </p>\r\n<p>Is there any chances that I can get the addon back as it was?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/skeeeig\">skeeeig</a>","created_at":"2012-03-11T21:41:00Z"},{"body":" <p>I'm well aware of what addon you submitted a ticket for.
