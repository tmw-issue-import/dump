{"issue":{"title":"[CF 932] Icon Toggle through Keybind ","body":" <p>Hi, been a while.</p><p>I was wondering if there was any way (existing or easily implementable) to enable/disable an icon via a keybind during combat. I could get the functionality that I want with another metaicon, but it'd be about 95% the same as an already existing metaicon. It would be much more convenient to just dynamically enable/disable the one icon that sets them apart.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/932\">#932</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/932.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-04-13T19:10:16Z","created_at":"2014-03-17T17:33:54Z","updated_at":"2014-04-13T19:10:16Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Make a macro (this is for 7.0.0, hence the profile/global in the command.
