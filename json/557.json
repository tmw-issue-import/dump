{"issue":{"title":"[CF 557] Shaman Shock Range Check ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create an icon to monitor the cooldown of any Shaman shock spell.<br>2.

For instance, turning off the Usable property (with the Unusable property on) causes the icon to simply not show.\r\n- As I mentioned in my ticket, the cooldown shows properly after the very first cast, but not on subsequent casts.\r\n- It is not related to interaction with another addon (I tested by turning all other addons off).</p>\r\n<p>I've uploaded an image of my TMW window (which does not show the Earth Shock CD) and my actionbars (showing the cooldown on Earth Shock and Frost Shock):\r\n<img src=\"http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/1088/tmwbug.png\" alt=\"TMW bug\"></p>\r\n<p>And the exact string I got the screenshot with:\r\n^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Scooldown ^SDurationAlpha^N0.2 ^SShowTimerText^B ^SDurationMaxEnabled^B ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SRangeCheck^B ^SEnabled^B ^SUnAlpha^N0.5 ^SDurationMax^N1.5 ^SName^SEarth`Shock ^t^N60101^S`| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully this helps.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/sirtyface\">sirtyface</a>","created_at":"2012-08-30T11:50:58Z"},{"body":" <p>Still can't reproduce it.
