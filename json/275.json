{"issue":{"title":"[CF 275] Rune cooldown icon type ","body":" <p>Mistay said<br>Friday, August 12, 2011 11:00:32 PM (16 hours ago)</p><p>I really like the frames of TellMeWhen, and my current setup doesn't show my runes unless I use MagicRunes, and I don't really like the layout of it. Is it possible to make a TellMeWhen bar specifically to show my runes coming on and off cooldown, and during the cooldown, just like on default UI?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/275\">#275</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/275.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-08-25T17:57:54Z","created_at":"2011-08-13T22:47:54Z","updated_at":"2011-08-25T17:57:54Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
