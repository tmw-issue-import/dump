{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1259] Abilities with two charges ","body":" <p>Is there any easy way of tracking an enemy's cooldown with multiple charges such as Iceblock or Blessing of Protection/Sacrifice/Freedom? They have 2 charges and it would be awesome if I could track that. I know there are addons such as Omnibar who do this but it would be nice if I could do this with TellMeWhen somehow.
