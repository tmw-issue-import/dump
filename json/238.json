{"issue":{"title":"[CF 238] Manually select icon image for groups of spells (or even for any icon) ","body":" <p>Is it possible to manually select icon image for groups of spells or even for any icon on TMW bars?</p><p>I noticed that if I use \"buff/debuff not present\" option for group of spells then the icon is of the first spell in spell id list in TellMeWhen.lua. And it is so only if the first spell's id does not begin with \"_\" symbol (Maybe it is a bug? I use non-english client.).</p><p>I removed this symbol from all spell ids in spell groups which I track as not present on the target as a temporary workaround.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/algus2\">algus2</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/238\">#238</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/238.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-06-26T19:48:27Z","created_at":"2011-06-26T17:54:22Z","updated_at":"2011-06-26T19:48:27Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>An underscore preceding a spellID in the equivalancies will convert that ID into a name, causing the icon to check all debuffs named \"rend\" instead of only the warrior rend (just an example). The latest alpha (r124) Fixed this for the most part.
