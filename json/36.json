{"issue":{"title":"[CF 36] Clarification of new linked-to-icon-state in v2 ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Set up the 3 icons on a Frost DK<br>2. Get Freezing Fog or Killing Machine to Proc without having enough RP (40 or 32 with the glyph) to use Frost Strike<br>3. Note that the Frost Strike icon still lights up in combat</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</p><p>I would expect the \"show when other icon is shown\" behaviour to be on top of the existing \"cooldown: show when usable\" behaviour, rather than in place of it.&nbsp; In v1, if you made (for example) an item cooldown that was linked to your mana level (e.g. show Endless Mana Potion when mana &lt; 100%) then the icon would not appear if you were &lt; 100% and the item was on CD or otherwise unusable.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?</p><p>2.0.0-beta1</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>N/A</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>Here is an icon excerpt (all from group 1) to trigger the behaviour:</p><p>&nbsp;
