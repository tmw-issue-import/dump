Track missing debuffs on enemy with one icon (druid) ","body":" <p>Goal: Show the non-applied spell icon in order when target is missing that particular debubb/dot, in Order</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What I'm trying to do:</p>\r\n<p>-Create \"missing buff/debuff\" group</p>\r\n<p>-what to track:&nbsp;Rake; Trash; Moonfire; Rip</p>\r\n<p>-who to watch: target</p>\r\n<p>-Debuff checkbox selected</p>\r\n<p>-Only cast by me selected</p>\r\n<p>-Duration requirement: minimum 0:01</p>\r\n<p>-Opacity and colod: Duration &lt; 1 hidden, Any abscent: 100%, All applied: hidden</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Problem: Any one of the debuff is applied, the button turns to hidden.
