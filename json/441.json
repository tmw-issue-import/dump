TMW already follows such a philosophy a little but, but it is not nearly modular enough to allow alternate Views just yet.</p>\r\n<p>I will start hacking away at a real framework that will support bars (and other display methods) as time is available, but don't get your hopes up that it will be in the next month, even.
