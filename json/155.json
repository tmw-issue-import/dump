{"issue":{"title":"[CF 155] Scrollable dropdown menus ","body":" <p>Having a \"Losecontrol\" setup with 2 meta icons for player, party1-4 and target with 4 subicons for each meta to prioritize what they show, the dropdown menus becomes quite huge and hard to navigate. I'm also at the limit of icons I can reach at the top. It would be awesome for the dropdown menu of available icons for the meta icon to have a definite height and to be scrollable. Thanks for a great addon.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Catok\">Catok</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/155\">#155</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/155.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-04-10T03:40:14Z","created_at":"2011-04-10T00:18:22Z","updated_at":"2011-04-10T14:00:36Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The dropdown menus are made with blizzards dropdown menu \"library\", so scrollbars won't be possible.
