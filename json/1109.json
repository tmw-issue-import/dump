{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1109] Is it possible to add a icon size change animation? ","body":" <p>Is it possible to add an animation that would change icon size for a set number of seconds, ideally smoothly changing between base and new size and back? Something like current Icon Flash animations, only for icon size instead of opacity/color? WeakAuras analogues would be Pulse and/or Zoom animations.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nordveien\">nordveien</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1109\">#1109</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1109.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-04-19T06:52:20Z","created_at":"2015-04-17T23:11:20Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T18:08:53Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>No, this isn't possible with TMW. I've tried extensively in the past, and it simply doesn't work with the way that icons are structured. It work with things like single images (in WeakAuras), but with complex objects like TMW icons, it looks horrible when you try to do it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-04-19T06:52:12Z"},{"body":" <p>I see, thank you for the response.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nordveien\">nordveien</a>","created_at":"2015-04-19T18:08:53Z"}]}
