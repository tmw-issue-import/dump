This also applies to macros, and will mark the macro as disabled until you reload the UI. Currently this only applies in combat (example: Taint is active).</p>\r\n</blockquote> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-14T21:47:14Z"},{"body":" <p>Parentheses warning box not going a way definitely is a bug, though.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-14T21:47:49Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20527%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20527%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>Could you be more specific about what that shitstorm means?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-08-14T21:56:15Z"},{"body":" <p>Rewriting a lot of stuff. Possibly limiting group size to something much smaller.</p>\r\n<p>An addon-wide update (What happens when you toggle locked/unlocked, and a lot of other stuff) may have to update groups one by one instead of all at once, which could cause extreme problems in the cases of meta icons and icon shown conditions checking icons from other groups.</p>\r\n<p>Right now I'm just sitting here waiting impatiently for beta realms to come back up. I'm starting to get a bit stressed now because there are only three weeks until the pre-MoP patch (that includes all of the talent, interface, and other changes) hits, and there is still a lot of bugs to be worked out before TMW is ready for live.</p>\r\n<p>P.s.
