{"issue":{"title":"[CF 723] Rune icon type custom textures ","body":" <p>From Lov3star:</p><p>Another very small thing:</p><p>You can set a custom texture for the Death Knight Rune icon type. However, if you do this, the icon will not change to indicate a Death Rune is active.</p><p>My suggestion is to have 2 Custom Texture inputs for the Rune icon type: \"Normal\" and \"Death Rune\" textures. If the user enters nothing for the \"Death Rune\" texture, it will just default to TMW's special \"Death Presence\" texture when the Rune enters a Death state.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/723\">#723</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/723.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-04-21T00:51:41Z","created_at":"2012-12-04T01:58:05Z","updated_at":"2013-04-21T00:51:41Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[]}
