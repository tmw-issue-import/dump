It doesn't appear to be doing what I want it to do. It appears to be setup as a spell cooldown. Just to reiterate, I want to know when I don't have the buff - at this point I want the icon to appear and stay on my screen until I have the buff again while in combat and alive (thank you for some of the conditions). Effectively, I lay down 2 RoP and with heavy movement, I may slide to the edge of the RoP area. If I slide too far, I will be out of the RoP area and want TMW to let me know.
