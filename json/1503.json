You should disable it under interface &gt; action bars &gt; show numbers for cooldowns.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Install OmniCC which as far as I am aware has the most timer text options and is specifically designed for timer text so it is light weight. You can edit the settings there.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That being said, OmniCC options can only edit things across the board and not for individual addons/icons. If the addon author replies (with the new expansion round the corner he might not have time), there may be specific tags you can use to create specific size timers by using text display dog tags on your icons main page. You can look at the syntax for these by clicking in a text display area and then clicking the red question mark at the top right.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>OmniCC has a size limit option though (if memory serves correctly) so you should be fine with that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PS: I didn't actually check if you need to untick the blizzard show numbers for cooldowns option when using Omni CC, so you may need to leave this enabled.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 10 2018 04:30:59 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1531215059\">Jul 10, 2018</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/bobthegoat2\">bobthegoat2</a>","created_at":"2018-07-10T09:19:54Z"}]}
