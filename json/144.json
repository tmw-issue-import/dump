{"issue":{"title":"[CF 144] ReducedArmor not detecting Sunder Armor debuff ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?</p><p>1. As a warrior, set up a \"ReducedArmor debuff missing on target\" icon and a \"Sunder Armor debuff missing on target\" icon<br>2. Engage an enemy; both icons should light up<br>3. Sunder or Devastate the target.&nbsp; The Sunder icon will disappear but the ReducedArmor icon will not.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>ReducedArmor should match against the Sunder Armor effect.&nbsp; It does not.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>4.0.0-beta7</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>No LUA errors.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>I believe the problem is that the ReducedArmor debuff is looking for spell id 7386, which is the ability \"Sunder Armor\", not the effect that is applied which is spell id 58567.&nbsp; The distinction probably comes from other abilities applying the effect like Devasate, glyphed Heroic Throw, and talented Revenge.</p><p>I have confirmed that replacing 7386 with 58567 on line 453 of TellMeWhen.lua fixes the issue.&nbsp; I can't imagine it having any side effects, as I don't believe it was ever been possible for spell 7386 to show up as a debuff.</p><p>The attached (mocked-up, excerpted) SV file should illustrate the problem, though i did set up by hand because I'm not in front of the game ATM.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Fonex\">Fonex</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/144\">#144</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/144.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-03-23T21:56:44Z","created_at":"2011-03-22T11:11:30Z","updated_at":"2011-03-23T21:56:44Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/68/TellMeWhen.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen.lua</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Fonex\">Fonex</a>","created_at":"2011-03-22T11:11:30Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks for the report!
