Switch the position of the two conditions of this icon and \"and\" will change to \"or\"</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>Because these are the only 2 conditions of the icon there seems to be no reason for them to change from \"and\" to \"or\"<br>This could possibly be the result of an intended behavior when switching the position of complex conditions?</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?

You're right that it's a bit weird when swapping conditions when there's only two of them, but the and/or and the parentheses are moved with a condition so that when you have say a group of 5 conditions all within parentheses, you can move a 6th up a spot or two and it will be inside that grouping, instead of having to redo all your parentheses.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-08-16T00:05:38Z"}]}
