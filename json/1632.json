{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1632] Visibility issues with \"icon\" dogtag ","body":" <p>When using the \"[Icon(data, size=0)]\" dogtag in the text layout of an icon, the displayed dogtag/custom icon does not follow visibility/opacity rules of the parent icon it is attached to, and will always be visible at 100% opacity. When the parent icon is invisible or hidden due to a condition for example, the custom icon will still show up on the screen (linked picture). This does not seem like intended behavior since, for example, a stack counter on a text layout will not be visible when the parent icon is hidden, and will also follow the parent icon's opacity setting as well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/imLoMrS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/imLoMrS</a></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/jadugarr\">jadugarr</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1632\">#1632</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1632.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-24T22:39:08Z","created_at":"2018-12-15T07:18:00Z","updated_at":"2018-12-24T22:39:08Z","labels":["cantfix"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Looks like something that Blizzard broke.
