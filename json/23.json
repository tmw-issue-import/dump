{"issue":{"title":"[CF 23] Holy Power ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?</p><p>If it were possible to assign a counter for core Holy Power I feel tellmewhen would be just that much more useful and powerful.&nbsp; Especially if you could assign icons to show when you only have a certain amount of power. For instance on my pally I would like to assign an icon for Templar's Verdict that will only appear when I have 3 Holy Power, there are current methods for other resource types where you can set boolean operators and I feel like Holy Power should be implemented there.&nbsp; Also just the concept of a counter in general for a resource would be awesome, one of the strong points of tellmewhen is that I can look at it instead of searching all around my screen for information that is valuable to me.&nbsp; I would love it if this was applied to all resources Holy Power, Mana, Combo Points, Focus, ect...</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>You guys are amazing please keep this addon going it is by far the most useful one I have!</p><p>-Ex Dunemaul US</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/srichards\">srichards</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/23\">#23</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/23.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-11-01T02:43:40Z","created_at":"2010-10-30T14:31:49Z","updated_at":"2010-11-01T02:43:40Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
