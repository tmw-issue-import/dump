All TMW export strings are forward compatible to an absurd degree, because they all keep a version number, and all settings upgrade code since version 1.0 is still in TMW and will still run on old strings. Backwards compatibility is rather pointless - just upgrade your installation of TMW if the string you're trying to import is newer than your current installed version.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-04-20T03:50:26Z"},{"body":" <p>Ok, thanks for clarification compatibility.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/dvdscripter\">dvdscripter</a>","created_at":"2018-04-23T23:30:02Z"}]}
