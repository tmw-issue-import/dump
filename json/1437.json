{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1437] Sounds not played on master volume, only on sound volume ","body":" <p>I like to play without ingame sound because its just a cacophony of noise during boss fights. Most bosses play a dialog speech which plays on dialog slider so I can hear them, and most mods play on the master volume slider, but TMW seems to play on the Sound slider instead, so I cant hear TMW sounds without turning up the sound slider. I can't hear the TMW sounds anyways though because of raid fight sound spam. Could you please change it to the master volume slider, or give the option to use master volume slider? thanks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ssateneth\">Ssateneth</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1437\">#1437</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1437.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-09-03T00:48:49Z","created_at":"2017-09-01T01:03:43Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T00:48:49Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Its in the general options, bottom left.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-09-03T00:48:43Z"}]}
