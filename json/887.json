Last Stand worked for me, and the ordering is great. </p>\r\n<p>However, Rallying Cry did not trigger - which was weird. I double-checked the lua and wow head, and 97462 seem to be the correct spell ID. I even created a single buff monitor to monitor just Rallying Cry (97462) and that also did not trigger. (This showed up as blue in the buff list which is correct according to wow head.)</p>\r\n<p>So I did a bit of digging and found another Rallying Cry - 97463. So I set up a bar to track 3 items: DefensiveBuffs, ID's 97462 and ID 97463. As I warrior, when I popped Rallying Cry, only the latter (97463) triggered to my surprise. So that seems to mean that wow head is wrong?</p>\r\n<p>I don't know what this means for your add-on … but clearly 97462 does not seem to be the Warrior Rallying Cry. 97463 seems to be the correct spell id. Which I think means a change in the DefensiveBuffs lua and maybe elsewhere is you specifically code the spell ids?</p>\r\n<p>Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?</p>\r\n<p>Hope this makes sense. Following is the simple tracker I made to test:</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SPoint^T ^Sy^F5638142526943906 ^f-46^Sx ^F-5184625008198999^f-51 ^t^SIcons^T ^N1^T ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SDefensiveBuffs ^SEnabled^B ^t^N2^T ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^S97462 ^SEnabled^B ^t^N3^T ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^S97463 ^SEnabled^B ^t^t^SGUID^STMW:group:1IXmO5RHXOG0 ^t^N70024^S`| ^Sgroup^N25 ^^</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Stanoslav\">Stanoslav</a>","created_at":"2013-11-16T05:55:56Z"},{"body":" <p>And for the record, tracking \"Rallying Cry\" (left click instead of right click), works, which makes sense if it is tracking all the possible spell id's for Rallying Cry.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Stanoslav\">Stanoslav</a>","created_at":"2013-11-16T05:58:52Z"},{"body":" <p>Wowhead is correct. <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=97462\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wowhead.com/spell=97462</a> has no buff associated. <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=97463\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wowhead.com/spell=97463</a> does.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-11-16T06:39:13Z"},{"body":" <p>Ah… I see the difference now. 97462/Blue is my ability which I can track the cool down, while 97463/Purple is the buff I get from using the ability.
