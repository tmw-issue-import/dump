{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1182] Problem with tracking \"snapshotting\" into bleeds (Feral Druid) ","body":" <p>My problem is that I want to show an icon for Savage Roar or Tiger's Fury WHEN I apply rip or rake to the target. Nothing seems to work. Spell Casts cannot track either rip or rake, and I don't know what else to use. I tried a combat event to show savage roar/tiger's fury with a condition; IF savage roar is applied to me when rip or rake is refreshed, that seem to make the icon show up, but I can't find any other solution to when i apply rip/rake.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>Expected: Show an icon of Savage Roar / Tiger's Fury IF applied to me WHEN i initially apply Rip/Rake on the target.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
