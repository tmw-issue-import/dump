{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1458] Notification Animations Getting Stuck On? ","body":" <p>Not sure how to describe the issue, but here goes. It seems that Animations like Activation Border get \"stuck on\" even when the icon that initiated the notification is no longer shown by the Meta Icon in which it triggered. When IconA triggers an Animation, and is then replaced by IconB, the Animation persists.
