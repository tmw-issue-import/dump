{"issue":{"title":"[CF 686] Request: Burning Embers 'fragment' tracking ","body":" <p>There is already a way to track the number of 'Burning Embers' here:</p><p><a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/forum/warlock/42454-destruction-track-burning-embers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/forum/warlock/42454-destruction-track-burning-embers/</a></p><p>However, each Burning Ember consists of 10 fragments, according to these two sources:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108647/burning-embers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108647/burning-embers</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108647-burning-embers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108647-burning-embers</a></p><p>It would be optimal if there were a way to see when a given Burning Ember is going to be up as opposed to only seeing when it is actually up e.g. making TMW track 0.1, 0.2, ... -&gt; 4.0 on the icon. I can only find the fragments definition under 'conditions' and I'm unsure of how to translate that into usefulness.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/catastrofe\">catastrofe</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/686\">#686</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/686.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-11-24T08:19:07Z","created_at":"2012-11-05T17:05:18Z","updated_at":"2012-11-24T08:19:07Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I will have to add a new tag to DogTag, but this is certainly something that is possible without a whole lot of effort.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-11-05T21:45:04Z"},{"body":" <p>I added new tags that should be included in TMW r670</p>\r\n<p>Use <code>[BurningEmbers]</code> and <code>[BurningEmberParts]</code> to track these.
