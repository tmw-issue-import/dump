{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1491] Add a dynamic bar type ","body":" <p>Will it be possible to have a bar type that has configurable min-max properties and tracks a counter (or a variable we can control with scripting)?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My thought is to allow hooks to create a UI component that we can control with LUA code. Examples could be a dynamic stagger bar, a dynamic absorb bar, more customizable resource tracking etc.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If such hooks already exist on a low level API - where can I start looking?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1491\">#1491</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1491.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-05-13T04:59:52Z","created_at":"2018-05-07T09:44:22Z","updated_at":"2018-05-13T04:59:52Z","labels":["enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You could create an icon type that can do this. <a href=\"https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/blob/master/Components/IconTypes/IconType_value/value.lua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/blob/master/Components/IconTypes/IconType_value/value.lua</a> would be the best one to start from.
