You will need to combine it with a Unit Exists condition to handle cases where you don't have a target.</p>\r\n<p>Comment #1: Oops. Will be fixed in the next revision.</p>\r\n<p>Comment #2: Yeah, I know. It is confined entirely to AceConfigDialog, though, so there is nothing I can do about it. It also doesn't seem to cause any undesired behavior, so I'm not worried about it. I've tried to figure out why it happens and how to fix it in the past, but I have never managed to figure it out.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-04-08T20:51:17Z"}]}
