{"issue":{"title":"[CF 206] SpellDamageTaken not working for Jinx ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: Attaching a saved variables file/screenshot will increase the likelihood of your problem being solved.<br>Saved variables can be found in: \"World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/&lt;Account Name&gt;/SavedVariables/TellMeWhen. lua\"</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Set up an icon for SpellDamageTaken debuff on target that shows when absent.<br>2. Cast Curse of the Elements on a target with an affliction specced warlock with 2/2 Jinx talent.<br>3. Select another target within 40 yard range that has the Jinx: Curse of the Elements debuff.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>The SpellDamageTaken debuff lists JInx:Curse of the Elements in the breakdown for the debuff but it doesn't seem to work for JInx.&nbsp; If I select the target which I originally cast Curse of the Elements on, the icon correctly does not appear.&nbsp; However, when I select the target with the Jinx:Curse of the Elements debuff, the icon appears when it should not.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
