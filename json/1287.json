Would you have any idea what might cause this, or if there is any possible work around? At least some info to send a bugreport to DBM devs if possible. Any help appreciated, and thanks alot for all your great work on TMW!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/grebneke\">grebneke</a>","created_at":"2016-08-29T10:14:48Z"},{"body":" <p>I use BigWigs myself, which would explain why I've never noticed this myself. Not sure why it would be happening. If you want to submit a bug report to DBM (I would appreciate it!), mention this:</p>\r\n<p>Parameter 4 to RaidNotice_AddMessage( noticeFrame, textString, colorInfo, displayTime ) seems to be ignored when DBM is enabled. Perhaps DBM is overriding this function and forcing the displayTime to a DBM-configured setting?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-09-05T00:57:17Z"},{"body":" <p>Sorry for the delay, reported @DBM now: <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/deadly-boss-mods/tickets/20-dbm-overrides-fake-raid-warning-durations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/deadly-boss-mods/tickets/20-dbm-overrides-fake-raid-warning-durations/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/grebneke\">grebneke</a>","created_at":"2016-09-12T08:04:33Z"},{"body":" <p>It's not something that's intentionally done. I'll probably start pruning some more under used legacy options/features until I can figure out which one fixes your issue. I'll push a test alpha of DBM with a a few things pruned to see if it solves issue.</p>\r\n<p>I know dbm overrides the position of RaidWarningFrame frame but it doesn't do anything else to it. which to be honest I'm not even sure why it does that so I may disable that as part of my pruning. There is a lot of legacy stuff here that I still end up running into from time to time that should be gotten rid of and this is probably one of them anyways.</p>\r\n<p>Try this version\r\n<a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/deadly-boss-mods/files/8355-7-0-4-13-g2ba1e36/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/deadly-boss-mods/files/8355-7-0-4-13-g2ba1e36/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 12 2016 04:11:50 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1473671510\">Sep 12, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mysticalos\">mysticalos</a>","created_at":"2016-09-12T08:33:48Z"},{"body":" <p>It turns out issue was not actually DBM but a 3rd party skinning solution that skins DBM (so disabling DBM disabled that skinning solution). None the less it helped me remove something that hasn't been used in a LONG time. DBM used to use RaidWarningFrame to add messages to chat years ago, but hasn't in forever, but was still repositioning it. So i got to remove that at least!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mysticalos\">mysticalos</a>","created_at":"2016-09-12T20:09:05Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks for the update!
