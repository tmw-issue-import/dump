{"issue":{"title":"[CF 536] Readd spec-specific groups? ","body":" <p>After updating TMW today I noticed the option to enable or disable a group based on spec was removed from the config UI (though still located in and working from the savedvariables file). While this option is pretty easy to apply still with group conditions, it makes configuring groups that occupy the same space somewhat annoying. Would it be possible to have the spec-specific setting put back in the group config UI?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Halsey1006\">Halsey1006</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/536\">#536</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/536.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-08-26T09:56:04Z","created_at":"2012-08-17T19:57:57Z","updated_at":"2012-08-26T09:56:04Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It is certainly still there.

I know why this is happening. In the mean time, since I probably won't push the next revision till tonight, simply reload your UI if they are not there. They will always be there, however, as long as TMW is locked when you first log into your character (doesn't matter if it is locked when reloading your UI)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-17T21:12:33Z"}]}
