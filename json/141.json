Really nice to know. I'm going to try this on the weekend.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe justa stupid question right now: when in a 25man raid, we're running with 2 or more tanks - how to distinguish between different maintanks?\r\nIs it something like maintank1 .. maintank2 ... for the tanks and maintank1target ... maintank2target ... for their targets?</p>\r\n<p>As you say the functionality is allready implemented, have i missed that blizzard added UnidID's for units marked as tanks or is it something that the TellMeWhen source has allready build functionality for?\r\nJust asking because if there are UnitIDs for these units allready, then i could use theses also in other addons i'm using which would be great!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"03 18 2011 07:51:45 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1300452705\">Mar 18, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Twister\">Twister</a>","created_at":"2011-03-18T12:50:11Z"},{"body":" <p>EDIT: I lied.

However, even if there are no direct UnitIDs assingned to maintanks there are events such as UNIT_AURA for their corresponding UnitID in the raid. (eg. like Raid4 or Raid 17)</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps it's possible to listen to <a href=\"http://wowprogramming.com/docs/events/RAID_ROSTER_UPDATE\" rel=\"nofollow\">RAID_ROSTER_UPDATE</a> for changes to main tank assignments and then setup an internal \"translation list\" MainTankX = RaidID by going through Raidmembers with <a href=\"http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api/GetPartyAssignment\" rel=\"nofollow\">GetPartyAssignment</a>?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Twister\">Twister</a>","created_at":"2011-03-22T14:10:03Z"},{"body":" <p>Yeah, that is what I was thinking too the other day when I realized how valuable being able to track this could be.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-03-22T22:56:51Z"},{"body":" <p>Alright, this will be implemented in beta8, but I haven't had a chance to test it yet.
