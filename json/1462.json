{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1462] Condition tracking for \"Unit Range\" Changed ","body":" <p>Hi there,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>the unit range of 6yds changed from precise to imprecise. I wanted to ask if this is just an indication error, a change or just my personal display bug. Is it intended to change the range from precise to imprecise for 6 yds?But instead the range meter for 7 yrds changed from imprecise to precise. Maybe I&acute;m a bit outdated the last time i noticed it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Greetings</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1462\">#1462</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1462.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-04-01T23:35:19Z","created_at":"2018-02-08T11:05:28Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T23:35:20Z","labels":["question","cantfix"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That condition uses <a href=\"https://www.wowace.com/projects/librangecheck-2-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.wowace.com/projects/librangecheck-2-0</a>.
