{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1435] Timer format -- seconds only ","body":" <p>Hello!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I wonder if there is a way to display spell cooldown in seconds only, even if its duration is more than 1 minute?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By default, both the cooldown of 119 sec and 61 sec will be displayed with text \"1m\".

The timer text is not provided by TMW - it comes from OmniCC, or Blizzard's default UI, or possibly some other addon you have installed (might be ElvUI).
