{"issue":{"title":"[CF 699] Overpower tracking, not really working \"right\"... ","body":" <p>Ok, so I've tried what I think is every conceivable way to track how Overpower works now. Basically if I setup a spell cooldown tracking, it literally always shows OP as available, which is technically is, but it's really not. Basically the icon is always just grey until it \"procs\". The only thing, there is no actual buff or proc you can track.</p><p>Overpower is now \"proced\" by Mortal Strike (right after a MS you can use OP), by a dodged attack or by being \"activated\" by Taste for Blood. So, I'm really curious if there is any possible way to track a true OP usability consider it's always considered usable, but it's not. It's \"activated\" by 3 different methods.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/xchrisgilroyx\">xchrisgilroyx</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/699\">#699</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/699.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-11-15T05:49:26Z","created_at":"2012-11-15T05:48:39Z","updated_at":"2012-11-15T05:49:52Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Forget it.
