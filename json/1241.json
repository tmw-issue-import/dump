{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1241] Condition based on timer other icon ","body":" <p>I want to make an icon show ONLY when the timer of another icon is &lt;30 sec. Currently there is only an option that checks if another icon is shown or hidden. There is no option based on time. There is a timer condition but I'm not sure what that is. How do I find out the name of the timer of another icon?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daniel1992\">daniel1992</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1241\">#1241</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1241.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-08-15T00:24:15Z","created_at":"2016-07-22T11:34:39Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T00:24:15Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Add a duration maximum of 30 seconds to that icon, and use the Icon Shown condition referencing the icon in question.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-22T22:51:23Z"}]}
