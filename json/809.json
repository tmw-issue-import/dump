{"issue":{"title":"[CF 809] Time until x Energy available ","body":" <p>Do you think it would be possible to make a condition (and lua condition) that can figure out the time till I have, say 50 energy available? So if i'm generating 10 energy per second and want the time till 50 energy available to be less than 2 seconds, I'd make a condition like \"time till 50 energy &lt;= 2 seconds\" and this condition would always pass if I'm above 30 energy.</p><p>There's two issues with just making an icon for \"energy &gt;= 30\". a) it doesn't take into account changing energy regeneration rates. b) I can't make something fancy like \"time till 50 energy &lt;= time till rupture fades\" (which is where lua would come into play).</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/809\">#809</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/809.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-05-12T03:27:23Z","created_at":"2013-05-10T14:57:30Z","updated_at":"2013-05-12T03:27:23Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20765%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/765-add-a-condition-energy-time-until-cap/</a></p>\r\n<p>Time till 50 energy &lt;= 2 seconds would look something like this:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n((50 - UnitPower(\"player\")) / GetPowerRegen()) &gt;= 2\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-05-10T16:46:37Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks alot.
