{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1404] Bar dimensions ","body":" <p>Currently you can set Icon scale, which essentially is setting the dimensions of a group's icons, to however big you want without having to fiddle by dragging the group when you try to match the icons to different elementents of your UI. This works ok since the icons have a fixed ratio between x and y and combined with the xy offset you can precisely determine the location of your icons.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, there is no similar option available to bar groups. Bars can have extremely varying xy dimensions based on your needs, and the scale variable changes both of those. There needs to be a seperate slider for both x and y dimensions in this case to allow finer tuning.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Qustav_R\">Qustav_R</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1404\">#1404</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1404.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-06-03T19:04:34Z","created_at":"2017-04-26T14:12:29Z","updated_at":"2018-06-03T19:04:34Z","labels":["resolved","enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p><a href=\"https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/pull/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/pull/1</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ariehg\">ariehg</a>","created_at":"2018-05-16T11:49:36Z"}]}
