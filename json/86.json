{"issue":{"title":"[CF 86] Internal Cooldown Tracking ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?<br>This should feel similar to NeedToKnow's internal cooldown, you can choose the name of the buff/debuff which triggers the ICD, and the user enters the ICD.</p><p>Examples:<br>-You gain trinket proc buff named \"X\", your TMW icon starts counting down from 45 seconds.<br>-You gain debuff Cauterize, your TMW icon starts counting down from 1 minute.<br>-Your target gains (your) debuff Improved Hamstring, your TMW icon starts counting down from 30 seconds.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.<br>Personally I much prefer using icons rather than bars - which is why I don't want to use NeedToKnow. Since ICDs can't be sourced from in-game without the use of data gathering, users will need to enter the ICD themselves. I'm not sure how adaptable the current code is in terms of creating a time based on a number rather than the duration left on a buff/debuff/cooldown.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/domzae\">domzae</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/86\">#86</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/86.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-01-27T00:07:37Z","created_at":"2011-01-14T10:13:34Z","updated_at":"2011-01-27T13:34:35Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It is definitely something that I have been considering doing, and sooner rather than later now that I have a request for it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-01-14T22:36:44Z"},{"body":" <p>ICD addon's are a pain at the moment, because they rely on the InternalCooldownLib 1.0 or something, which never gets updated.

(which is why the current one is so terrible imo) Something like what I suggest above would be flexible and versatile.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/warriorjedi\">warriorjedi</a>","created_at":"2011-01-25T05:47:28Z"},{"body":" <p>Blizzard just needs to add GetInternalCooldown().
