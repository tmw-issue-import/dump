{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1563] Add 'Insert Here' to menu option when dragging icon into a group ","body":" <p>Put it in the 'Move/copy/swap here' part. A few of my groups I have in very specific orders, and if I need to insert something new there, I have to move EVERYTHING down one space to add it. Would be nice to just press 1 button and have everything else shifted down one space.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1563\">#1563</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1563.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-09-01T20:16:35Z","created_at":"2018-08-25T23:20:00Z","updated_at":"2018-09-01T20:16:35Z","labels":["resolved","enhancement"]},"comments":[]}
