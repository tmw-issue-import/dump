What happens instead?<br>I expect that my voice file will play when my riptide or healing stream totem comes off cd (notification to play voice file 'on finish'). It either plays it constantly like an awful techno song of me repeatedly saying riptide (which is what the mp3 i use for the notification sound is of) or just plays it ass i cast and again when it comes off cd</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
