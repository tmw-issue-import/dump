{"issue":{"title":"[CF 396] Icon Timers Text ","body":" <p>I noticed that since some release versions, Icon Timer texts can only be enabled if OmniCC is installed ... I can understand the issue with that, but many of my guild raiders are using Tell Me When (since i defined as mandatory addon :D) with LUI UI ( <a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/lui/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/lui/</a> )</p><p>This interface hase the Auras Timer function to gain back OmniCC memory with an easier function ... Btw is it possible to enable the timer text without the \"omnicc\" condition that enable the combo box?</p><p>I don't use Omnicc since 1 year and when i configured Tell me When icons i checked for all the Timer text ... the result is that now timer text is workin' with my old configured icons, but if i create a new icon i can't enable timer text 'cause checkBox is not enable (i suppose you're doing an OmniCC loaded test to enable it).What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>I'm using last alpha of TellMeWhen (r 369)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Adam77\">Adam77</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/396\">#396</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/396.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-12-25T03:35:04Z","created_at":"2011-12-24T15:01:08Z","updated_at":"2011-12-25T15:15:09Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>After installing LUI and having it annihilate my UI in order to test a fix (did I mention that I hate pre-compiled UIs?), you should now be able to check the setting with LUI as the addon that handles cooldown counts in r370.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-12-25T03:18:11Z"},{"body":" <p>LOL ty a lot <span>:)</span></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Adam77\">Adam77</a>","created_at":"2011-12-25T15:15:09Z"}]}
