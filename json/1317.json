{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1317] Way to track amount of absorbs from Necrotic Strike? ","body":" <p>ATTACHING A SAVED VARIABLES FILE/SCREENSHOT WILL GET YOUR TICKET ANSWERED MUCH FASTER</p><p>Saved variables can be found in: \"World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/&lt;Account Name&gt;/SavedVariables/TellMeWhen. lua\"</p><p>What is the issue?</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>The icon and spell that i can currently track with TMW is 194310 which should be festering wound. I can track when i have festering wound on the target but i cant seem to find a way for it to show the amount of healing on the icon that is currently left to be absorbed. Its not a stack so it doesnt count stacks either. Idk if im just doing it wrong or if it is something you could do on your end. Any help is greatly appreciated and I love the addon &lt;3</p><p><a href=\"https://gyazo.com/8aadd53b3429e4aa66bd00cea055d3aa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gyazo.com/8aadd53b3429e4aa66bd00cea055d3aa</a></p><p>This is a SS of the spell.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Nappyhoe\">Nappyhoe</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1317\">#1317</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1317.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-22T19:10:27Z","created_at":"2016-10-17T19:59:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T19:10:27Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I see you posted in 2012 that you have to check \"show variable text\" in the buff /debuff section but i dont see that anywhere now</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Nappyhoe\">Nappyhoe</a>","created_at":"2016-10-17T20:10:01Z"},{"body":" <p><a href=\"https://gyazo.com/50ea535a53de97e7629551168910ed09\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gyazo.com/50ea535a53de97e7629551168910ed09</a> had the wrong ss</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Nappyhoe\">Nappyhoe</a>","created_at":"2016-10-17T20:15:41Z"},{"body":" <p><a href=\"https://gyazo.com/47c1bce0405502bb4805f7bac4071cce\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gyazo.com/47c1bce0405502bb4805f7bac4071cce</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gyazo.com/a0b57f0a606d97b8e43b8ed5764d98c7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gyazo.com/a0b57f0a606d97b8e43b8ed5764d98c7</a></p>\r\n<p>Found it out (sorry to keep replying to my comments) Ive been trying figure this out for weeks and finally messed with enough settings.
