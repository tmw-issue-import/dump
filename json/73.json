'Highlighting' the clock timer just shows it not moving at all stuck at 12 'oclock position.</p><p>I'm not sure what caused the problem. (the above error)<br>However the clock timers not showing up happened around the 4.0 WoW patch, when I decided to update/clean out unused addons in my addon folder, making me wonder whether I deleted an addon required to make the clock timers work. I also decided to update TellMeWhen to its newest version on that day; and was quite impressed with the additions to the addon. However, since then the clock timers didn't work so I have been checking for new versions since (and updating) in hopes the problem would be fixed.</p><p>In an attempt to start anew, I used the 'reset profile' (something along those lines) deleted the addon in my folder, and again installed TMW to the newest version. Upon log in I noticed TMW was not apart of the listed addons in Interface-&gt;Addons, leaving me unable to add/remove/edit group icons.</p><p>All I want is the clock timers back :P but also being able to play with the Conditions of the icons is definitely a plus.</p><p>I am using TellMeWhen 2.2.3a</p><p>Attached is my saved variables.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/strikes_\">strikes_</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/73\">#73</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/73.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-30T10:53:54Z","created_at":"2010-12-30T01:51:43Z","updated_at":"2010-12-30T10:53:54Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/177/TellMeWhen.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen.lua</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;Saved variables of TellMeWhen&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/strikes_\">strikes_</a>","created_at":"2010-12-30T01:51:43Z"},{"body":" <p>I am able to make the clock timers work fine on my warlock with your settings.

Updating it fixed this issue, now I feel dumb thinking I did the basic \"did you turn it on and off? is it plugged in?\" when in a sense I didn't. Hah.
