{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1637] Suggestion: add condition type: group size ","body":" <p>It would be really nice if TMW can add an condition type of \"<strong>group size</strong>\" (compatible of both party and raid).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I know there is a \"<strong><em>instance size</em></strong>\" condition type existing.</p>\r\n<p>But noticed that it only works based on \"instance\", which doesn't work for raid groups in worlds / maps outside of an \"instance\".</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example 1, the \"instance size\" is still and always 0 (zero) when I'm in a raid group of <strong>world boss, </strong>like <strong>dooms-howl </strong>in \"Arathi Highlands\"</p>\r\n<p>And example 2, it <em>seems</em> to be 0 (zero) when I'm in some big scenario, like <strong>Stromgarde warfront scenario</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/doneykoo\">doneykoo</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1637\">#1637</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1637.html\">Raw</a>","closed":false,"created_at":"2018-12-24T05:40:10Z","updated_at":"2018-12-24T05:40:41Z","labels":[]},"comments":[]}
