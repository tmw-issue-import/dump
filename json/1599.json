{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1599] Please Change How Icons Are Arranged When Adding and Moving Icons in a Meta ","body":" <p>When you currently add an icon to a Meta it appears at the bottom.&nbsp; When you move this icon to the top of the list, the icon that was at the top moves to the very bottom rather than just moving to be second in the list.&nbsp; Very annoying because now you have to rearrange ALL of the icons back to their original priority.&nbsp; Please change it so when moving icons in a meta to prioritize them, they don't move the icon to be replaced to the bottom.&nbsp; Just make it move down one.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daemon9\">daemon9</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1599\">#1599</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1599.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-10-22T00:53:04Z","created_at":"2018-10-21T04:01:33Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T02:58:22Z","labels":["invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The tooltips in TMW often contain very useful information about how a particular feature works.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(use left click, not right click)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-10-22T00:53:04Z"},{"body":" <p>Ahhh the tooltip...got it, thanks.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daemon9\">daemon9</a>","created_at":"2018-10-22T02:58:22Z"}]}
