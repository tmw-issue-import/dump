{"issue":{"title":"[CF 213] Bars not showing on screen ","body":" <p>Same as ticket below, typing /tmw does not bring up the tmw options, i can navigate to them from the interface/addons menu and it appears to be active although i cannot see it. When i /tmw i hear a sound like when you open talent window for example but nothing appears. Resettng the addon to default causes it to work again but once set up again and following a reload ui or relog i can again no longer see it.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
