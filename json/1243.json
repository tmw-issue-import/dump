{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1243] Warlock Resource Bug in v8.0.3 ","body":" <p>TMW Version: v8.0.3<br>Profile export: <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/UdBXWHBx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/UdBXWHBx</a></p><p>Hello! Awesome addon!</p><p>I have been using TMW for a while now. With the launch of 7.0.3 and the addon's update however, I am facing a slight error on my warlocks.</p><p>When the addon loads (login/reload) I get a message saying \"Equivalencies.lua:473: processing\" in the chatbox. Closer investigation also shows that the Soul Shard option seems slightly bugged but behaves alright.</p><p>Screenshot: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2a7EFkM\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/2a7EFkM</a></p><p>The bug doesn't seem critical in any fashion, but it does cause some quality of life inconveniences. If it could be fixed I would be a very very happy man!</p><p>Thank you and keep up the good work.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/anty2004gr\">anty2004gr</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1243\">#1243</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1243.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-23T19:21:26Z","created_at":"2016-07-23T10:20:16Z","updated_at":"2016-07-23T19:21:26Z","labels":["defect","duplicate"]},"comments":[]}
