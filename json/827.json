I create a Shield Block cooldown icon<br>2. I have OmniCC on<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>I was expecting to have the CD displayed as text like it happens on Taunt, for example. Instead, it doesn't show the cd, only the rage necessary to use the spell, which I have also configured.<br>Is it because Shield Block has a Recharge of 9s instead of a cd? How to I track this type of spell?</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
