{"issue":{"title":"[CF 752] Specific being cast - condition ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>6.1.1</p><p>I have a large number of standard \"spell cooldown\" icons. I want to add a condition so that if the specific spell for that icon is in the process of being cast, the condition will fail (icon will hide). For instance on my warlock I show when Haunt is usable but want to hide it if I am in the process of casting Haunt; Lava Burst for a shaman; Frost Bomb mage etc. Could you assist me with this or let me know if perhaps its just not possible.</p><p>Thanks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Maven79\">Maven79</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/752\">#752</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/752.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-02-04T17:56:53Z","created_at":"2013-02-03T02:33:08Z","updated_at":"2013-02-04T17:56:53Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Just use a Spell Cast condition, entering the name of the cast and setting the slider to Present (the middle value).</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6FnClA3.png\" alt=\"\"></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"02 3 2013 00:27:21 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1359872841\">Feb 3, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-02-03T06:25:06Z"},{"body":" <p>Works great, thank you.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Maven79\">Maven79</a>","created_at":"2013-02-04T16:58:31Z"}]}
