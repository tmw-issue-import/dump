Swift. procs = pops up on the icon bar alerting me I can use the instant healing touch spell + some sound notification. Please tell me what you need to know, if Im not specific enough. Im a fresh user never used this addon before. I tried to set it up myself, but somehow, I obviously fail to do that by just intuition. My way was to set condition - I did set these 4 values (spell charges / Predatory Swiftness / == / 0)\r\nIn notification I did set - On show - sound Humm</p>\r\n<p>Is that possible to set this up ?
