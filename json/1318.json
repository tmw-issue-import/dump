{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1318] Monk's Fist of Fury stun (PvP) not being tracked by DR ","body":" <p>I don't think I need a string here, seeing as how it is pretty clear what is wrong. If you make a group using the \"Diminishing Returns\" drop down. And set it to track \"DR stuns\" it does not track when someone is stunned by Fist of Fury. It just acts like it never happened. This seems to also be true for Gladius' DR's. I do not know if this is a game problem, or if there is something I can do as far as TMW settings to make this work. But being in the 2k plus bracket in 2's with a h pally, it is really bad when it says both targets are off dr, and my pally goes to 5 sec stun and it is immune. Thank you for your help, and thank you for keeping TMW up to date! Couldn't play with out it.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/leflos1\">leflos1</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1318\">#1318</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1318.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-22T19:21:33Z","created_at":"2016-10-21T17:30:04Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T03:36:43Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is an issue with DRData-1.0, but I've fixed it nonethless.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-10-22T19:21:24Z"},{"body":" <p>It was fixed after i downloaded the beta version, (awesome time frame too less then 24 hours it was fixed) now that the new download came out for 7.1 , the problem has returned ):</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/leflos1\">leflos1</a>","created_at":"2016-10-27T03:36:43Z"}]}
