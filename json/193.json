{"issue":{"title":"[CF 193] Sparkly Border Please ","body":" <p>Could we please get an option to show a \"sparkly border\" when appropriate?&nbsp; Although TMW is not a \"bar mod\", it's really positioned to replace certain bar mods ... so as a user moving away from one of those bar mods, I am kind of expecting the TMW icon to light up when I get a proc.

One of the core principles of TMW is that icons can be shown at different alpha levels or hidden altogether based on usability/presence. That aside, the implementation would also be very awkward. Should the border show up whenever the \"green alpha setting\" (present/usable) is being used? It would make more sense for buffs to show it when they are missing, but for debuffs to show it when they are present on a friendly unit or absent on a hostile unit. Or should the border just be based off of conditions? If so, there probably needs to be a way to set it to show only when certain conditions have passed so that isn't just always showing when the conditions are passing. Also, it looks like crap with round ButtonFacade skins.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-05-14T01:02:12Z"}]}
