{"issue":{"title":"[CF 818] Prayer of Mending ","body":" <p>I've been digging up my priest and tried making an icon for tracking Prayer of Mending. The idea is that I can get an icon alerting me if nobody in the raid is affected by my Prayer of Mending. Unfortunately checking raid 1-40 checks whether any of the raid members have Prayer of Mending missing, not if they all have it missing. And checking for every raidmember separately would require 40 conditions.<br>Also there's the minor issue that the icon always thinks that Mending is missing between the moment that it fades on one player and it gets applied on another. I can work around that by starting a 0.5 second combat event timer when Mending fades and connecting that as an icon shown condition with the main icon, making the main icon wait 0.5 seconds before taking action. Is there maybe a more elegant solution?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/818\">#818</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/818.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-05-30T16:29:01Z","created_at":"2013-05-26T03:07:03Z","updated_at":"2013-05-30T16:29:01Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This seems to be doing the job for me:</p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SUnit^Sraid;~`party;~`player ^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SPrayer~`of~`Mending ^SShowWhen^N1 ^SEnabled^B ^t^N62201^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p>\r\n<p>You will probably want to add a condition to check the cooldown.</p>\r\n<p>As far as preventing the icon from showing while it is jumping goes - there isn't really any elegant solution to this.
