When set to 'show icon when usable' and 'power check', the icon always shows whether you have power (rage in this case) or not. Strangely, this bug only seems to happen when you target yourself or friendlies.</p><p>What is the expected output?&nbsp;&nbsp; Icon should follow 'unusable' rules</p><p>What version of the product are you using?&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.3a</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mantooth555\">Mantooth555</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/74\">#74</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/74.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-30T09:12:27Z","created_at":"2010-12-30T06:58:56Z","updated_at":"2010-12-30T09:12:43Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/181/TellMeWhen.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen.lua</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mantooth555\">Mantooth555</a>","created_at":"2010-12-30T06:58:56Z"},{"body":" <p>1) You are not using 2.2.3a, but rather 2.1.2</p>\r\n<p>2) Your intercept icon is set to always show, instead of only when usable like you say it is.</p>\r\n<p>3) I am unable to reproduce this.</p>\r\n<p>4) You say that the expected output is that it should follow unusable rules, but you say it is set to show when usable, when it is actually set to always show.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"12 30 2010 03:12:43 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1293700363\">Dec 30, 2010</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-12-30T09:12:19Z"}]}
