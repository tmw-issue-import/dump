Try removing the source unit filter and see if that helps. It should work though - I checked BigWigs, and it watches for a SPELL_CAST_START combat log event for it (which is what you selected).</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-07-03T07:15:26Z"},{"body":" <p>It happens every so often, certainly not COMMON by any means.

The window for choosing config options sometimes scales with the size of the aura you right click.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>E: Also I think I figured out the KJ aura. I had destination set to player when I don't care at all if he casts it on me...I must have been tired every time I looked at it.</p>\r\n<p>E2: Ok the REAL reason it wasn't working (besides the player=destination) was that I had a group condition for mythic raid and I pulling heroic at the time.
