{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1196] Making Icons Check Specific Raid Frames ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>7.4.0</p><p>I want to make icons check specific party members and attach this icons to those party members raid frames (default blizzard raid frames). Also i prefer to have \"sort by role\" checked in raid frames settings. So far i dont find any way to do this. Just check raid frame for buff instead of party member could be a viable solution but at the same way it could be very messy, coz anchors always different, some times it can be CompactRaidFrame2HealthBar next time its gonna be CompactRaidFrame22HealthBar at the same spot, so im gonna need to setup all of them from 1 to 40. I just wanna do it is some way. Pretty much i wanna the same that this man <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20983%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/983-making-icons-check-specific-raid-frames/</a> but with default raid frames, and i want to be able to use \"sort by role\" option with it.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Hearthstonemakesmemad\">Hearthstonemakesmemad</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1196\">#1196</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1196.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T23:03:23Z","created_at":"2016-04-03T02:02:25Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T23:03:23Z","labels":["declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Also it may look like i now how to check raid frame for buff instead of party member, but i dont.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Hearthstonemakesmemad\">Hearthstonemakesmemad</a>","created_at":"2016-04-04T01:20:01Z"},{"body":" <p>I check this thread almost everyday.
