{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1132] Tracking cooldowns with charges ","body":" <p>I know it's not possible with the current TellMeWhen but it could be easily solved if there was an option to \"not refresh\" the timer while the timer is already running. Right now if you cast Hand of Freedom for example, the timer ticks down from 25 seconds. But if they cast it again within those 25 seconds it refreshes back to 25. If there was somehow an option to not \"refresh\" this timer while it's counting down then it would be very easy to track charges.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daniel1992\">daniel1992</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1132\">#1132</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1132.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-06-11T03:40:32Z","created_at":"2015-06-11T03:37:26Z","updated_at":"2015-06-11T03:40:32Z","labels":["defect","duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Please direct feedback about this functionality to ticket 1087.
