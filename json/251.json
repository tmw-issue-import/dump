To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click on the arrow next to the editbox labeled \"The editbox of sharing...\". Select the \"Export to string\" option, and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>boglee said<br>Thursday, June 30, 2011 9:59:34 AM (3 days ago)<br>here it is:</p><p>^1^T^SType^Stotem ^STotemSlots^S0011 ^SStealable^b ^SEnabled^B ^t^N44201^^</p><p>Cybeloras said<br>Thursday, June 30, 2011 5:19:57 PM (2 days ago)<br>I haven't got a clue.
