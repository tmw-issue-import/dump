{"issue":{"title":"[CF 730] Ox/Serpent Stance &amp; Power Bar Overlay ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>the \"power bar overlay\" does not work for the Monk skill Jab when in Ox and Serpent Stance. This also seems to be the case for other skills that have no cooldown and require x energy/mana (e.g. Spinning Crane Kick). In Tiger stance however, it is working fine.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>expected: to see the energy missing to be able to cast the skill<br>instead: when in Ox/Serpent stance, the icon is stuck in the \"usable\"-state, even when \"Power check\" is true and my energy is below 40 (or below the skill's mana cost)</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
