If the issue is still happening for you, does it happen with all other addons disabled? Blizzard did do some patches around the chat API about a week ago - it could be some other addon you have is reacting poorly to those changes they made. This hypothetical addon could, for example, be trying to patch the implementation of SendChatMessage, but encountering an error in the process and leaving things in an unrecoverable state.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-08-13T20:23:39Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks for the response! Just got home and started checking addons. Turns out it seems to be a conflict with Roth UI for some reason. I think it's a library conflict. I'm going to close this since it seems to be a different addon that's actually causing the problem.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Edit: Looks like both addons use Ace3 libraries.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 13 2018 22:30:27 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1534217427\">Aug 13, 2018</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/apsithia\">apsithia</a>","created_at":"2018-08-14T03:27:35Z"}]}
