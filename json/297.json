{"issue":{"title":"[CF 297] Export entire groups/profiles ","body":" <p>Marenwynn said<br>Friday, September 30, 2011 9:05:48 PM (14 hours ago)</p><p>I love this addon. :D I've been using it for over a year to track all my DoTs, CDs, and encounter mechanics in what I like to call a battle grid. I feel it's given me the edge to rank as highly as I did last tier.</p><p>One thing I would like to request is an easier way of sharing an entire TMW profile. In the past, I've had to cut out parts of TellMeWhen.lua in the SavedVariables folder to do this, and it can be confusing for a lot of people. The export strings can be a rather slow way to share trackers, especially with the extensive \"programming\" of TMW through chains of Meta Icons that I've done for it to function in certain ways (like all three specs in a few icons).</p><p>It would be awesome if each profile had its own file that could be adopted by other players through something as simple as renaming the filename to match their character's name. :)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/297\">#297</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/297.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-10-03T03:20:56Z","created_at":"2011-10-01T18:13:58Z","updated_at":"2011-10-03T03:20:56Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
