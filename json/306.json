{"issue":{"title":"[CF 306] \"Unit triggered\" variable ","body":" <p>First I want to thank you for implementing custom channel output, its very useful for me.<br>I have another request for enhancement for the Text Output, which complements it.</p><p>It will be very helpful if we will be able to have a variable for the unit that triggered the event.<br>For example, I have the following text output:<br>\"Healer was hit by Lava Wave!\" and its only triggered when specific players (in this case the names of our healers) were hit by a Lava Wave.</p><p>If we had a variable that contained the unit that triggered the event the text line could be more specific as in:<br>\"%u was hit by Lava Wave!\" so %u will be replaced by the unit name that triggered the event, so the actual text output from this event will be \"Feiloose was hit by Lava Wave!\".</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br>F.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/feiloose\">feiloose</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/306\">#306</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/306.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-10-13T22:49:05Z","created_at":"2011-10-11T16:00:09Z","updated_at":"2011-10-13T22:49:05Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
