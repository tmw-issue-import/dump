Right now, the timer is not modified when a spell is on the GCD and the GCD is set to be ignored (in the blizz interface options panel for TMW). Once the cooldown for the spell is reset, it becomes on the GCD, or whatever remains of the GCD after the last spell. Once the GCD is over, the cooldown timer is properly reset.</p>\r\n<p>When testing only the ability, the GCD is not being invoked, thus it works properly. While doing a normal rotation, though, the GCD is being constantly invoked, causing it to break.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-12-10T23:15:54Z"},{"body":" <p>The only logical way that i can think of to fix this would be to just disable the option to have timers ignore the GCD. Having exceptions to a spell would cause the spell to not match the settings of the other icons, which is the only other thing that came to mind. If you can think of a way to make this work then let me know, but for now I'm just going to let this one go.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-12-10T23:31:36Z"}]}
