At the moment I'm using a substitute of combat tracking and having the icon react to anything a particular add does which causes sever 0.5 fps lag in a 40 man raid if I forget to turn it off. xD</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"12 26 2014 06:50:28 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1419598228\">Dec 26, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/felrece\">felrece</a>","created_at":"2014-12-26T12:49:55Z"},{"body":" <p>BigWigs doesn't correctly detect the end of an encounter if you feign.
