{"issue":{"title":"[CF 473] Allow totem conditions to check names ","body":" <p><a href=\"http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tellmewhen?comment=1892\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tellmewhen?comment=1892</a></p><p>Firstly I must say this addon is great. I haven't really had much issue with it until recently. And the issue I do have is really quite monor but a cause of frustration nonetheless. I have been trying to set up a priority queue for my enhance shaman. I wanted to try and differentiate between aoe and single target. The way I was going to do this was by setting up a meta icon which reads two hidden groups. One group was going to contain all my single target abilities and the other was going to include all my aoe abilities, both in order of priority. Each group was going to have a condition based on a particular totem i.e. searing totem for single target and magma for aoe. Unfortunately however I discovered there is no condition I can seemily use to meet these criteria. The only totem condition I can find is to search for a totem of a particluar element. I did see a unit exists command, but this cannot be used as far as I can tell to search for a given totem. Any help would much appreciated.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/473\">#473</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/473.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-02T02:17:37Z","created_at":"2012-03-28T04:18:18Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T02:17:37Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added in r500 (woohhh, milestone!)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-02T02:17:30Z"}]}
