{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1309] Cannot Track GrimServ Demons ","body":" Heya, I made a post over on Curse but was directed here. Hopefully it's not in bad taste to copypaste.I am running TMW v8.2.0 r23 (g357b087)For the Warlock I am having trouble tracking units summoned via the tier 90 talent Grimoire of Service. I have set up a simple All-Unit Buffs/Debuffs tracker in bar format set to track Grimoire of Service but sometimes it does not even show and when it does after the summoned unit has despawned it stays shown until a /reload. Here is the bar I made.^1^T^SGUID^STMW:group:1Ny0HGKEm_aj ^SScale^F6834314633281541 ^f-52^SPoint ^T^Sy^F5903817771244353 ^f-47^Sx ^F-6627307938856742^f-45 ^t^SEnabledSpecs^T ^N265^b ^N267^b ^t^SView^Sbar ^SColumns^N1 ^SIcons^T ^N1^T ^SType^Sdotwatch ^SName^SGrimoire~`of~`Service ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^SEnabled^B ^t^N2^T ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N3^T ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N4^T ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^t^SName^SGrimServ ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sbar^T ^SSizeX^F5677192461680633 ^f-45^t ^t^SControlled^B ^t^N82003^S~`~| ^Sgroup^N17 ^^Before resorting to that I tried tracking units summoned via Grimoire of Service with the new Guardians tracking feature but there is no option to track Felguard, Felhunter, etc. I tried entering their names manually, but to no avail.I know you've been working hard on the addon and I appreciate it. Sorry if I am being a bother or if there is just some simple hiding in plain sight solution here. \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Monkaddons\">Monkaddons</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1309\">#1309</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1309.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-09T19:09:49Z","created_at":"2016-10-02T17:21:18Z","updated_at":"2016-10-09T19:09:49Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Also have a possible bug associated with the Guardians feature.

When I switch specs and do damage in that spec but then switch back to Demonology the guardian tracker will not show. The fix for this is simply typing /tmw to bring up options. </p>\r\n<p>1) Create guardian tracker in Demonology </p>\r\n<p>2) Switch to Affliction/Destro and do dmg</p>\r\n<p>3) Switch back to Demonology and the trackers dont show</p>\r\n<p>4) Must type /tmw to enter options and it will usually fix it</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, Cy</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Monkaddons\">Monkaddons</a>","created_at":"2016-10-02T18:23:18Z"}]}
