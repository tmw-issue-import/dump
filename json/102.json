It turns out that it wasn't breaking timers. It still was breaking CoolLine, though, which is the most bizarre thing ever. It only breaks it if the option is enabled, though, so I'm not really going to worry about it. Worst case scenario is that people just won't use the option if they use CoolLine.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-01-25T19:19:54Z"}]}
