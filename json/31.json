{"issue":{"title":"[CF 31] Buffs equivalence ","body":" <p>Actually i'm using TellMeWhen for procs, cds and as a buff reminder.</p><p>for example I use 1 of tellmewhen's windows to show on my paladin when BOK is missing... If Mark of the Wild is already active on me, tellmewhen will show that i'm missing BOK, but i can't cast it 'cause the same buff is active...</p><p>I hope to let you understand what i mean.
