{"issue":{"title":"[CF 406] Some debuffs missing in the debuff categories ","body":" <p>I used to have an icon that named every single debuff I wanted to check for. Recently I became aware that you could just name debuffs per group like \"rooted\" or \"stunned\". The icon is much tidier now, but I have experienced that some debuffs don't seem to be properly working. Intimidating Shout for example appears if you get feared by the aoe-effect. However it is absent if you are the target of Intimidating Shout, in which case the debuff has a different spell-ID (20511). I think I have experienced this with other debuffs too, but I can't say for sure because that ususally happened in the middle of some aoe-fest, where I couldn't check.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/406\">#406</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/406.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-01-04T00:49:29Z","created_at":"2011-12-31T13:34:33Z","updated_at":"2012-01-09T02:42:18Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added 20511 to Feared.
