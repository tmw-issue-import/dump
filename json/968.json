{"issue":{"title":"[CF 968] Adding the ability to distinguish scenarios from other instance types ","body":" <p>It would be nice to be able to distinguish between scenarios and 5-mans or higher. Perhaps adding scenarios to instance types or having a condition to check for number of players in group. As a hunter I like my pet growl notification to pop up in dungeons and raids but I actually WANT my pet to tank in most scenarios. Currently setting instance type to \"&gt;= 5 players\" includes scenarios as well.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ookin\">ookin</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/968\">#968</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/968.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-07-19T04:50:57Z","created_at":"2014-07-15T16:40:57Z","updated_at":"2014-07-19T04:50:57Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I re-worked the instance type condition in the latest version.
