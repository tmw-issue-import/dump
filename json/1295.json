{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1295] Track visibility state of non-controller icons in controlled group ","body":" <p>Currently it isn't possible to track the visibility status of icons other than the group controller in controlled groups. I would like to be able to do so, primarily as a means of tracking how many instances of a particular debuff I have active.</p><p>As a specific example, if I have an invisible group controlled by tracking all instances I have active of thrash, if I was to track the visibility status of the 4th icon in the group, that would tell me that I currently have (atleast) 4 instances of thrash active currently. In this case, it would or could be used as a pseudo-aoe check (x number of targets minimum with debuff = altered priority list).</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/user_976011\">user_976011</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1295\">#1295</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1295.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-09-10T18:22:06Z","created_at":"2016-09-10T08:50:07Z","updated_at":"2016-09-10T18:22:06Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I'll keep yours since the one I made a few hours before this one was a little sparse on the details <span>:)</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201294%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/1294-allow-selection-of-controlled-icons-for-metas-condition/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 10 2016 12:21:11 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1473528071\">Sep 10, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-09-10T17:20:29Z"},{"body":" <p>g4f8bbf5 </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/files/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/files/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-09-10T17:50:34Z"}]}
