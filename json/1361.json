{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1361] Only some groups appearing ","body":" <p>So I know this could be something coming when the addon is updated for 7.1.5 but since I logged in only 1 out of the 5 groups I use for my shadow priest appears. The other groups are still there in my character pane and the anchors are still where they should be as well, but no icons appear. Any ideas?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Madfrick\">Madfrick</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1361\">#1361</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1361.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-01-14T18:40:05Z","created_at":"2017-01-10T16:46:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T18:40:05Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Same issue here</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 10 2017 17:01:23 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1484089283\">Jan 10, 2017</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/loclay2\">loclay2</a>","created_at":"2017-01-10T23:01:14Z"},{"body":" <p>You most likely have Lua errors turned off but this is related to the same issue here:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201360%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1360</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 10 2017 18:35:23 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1484094923\">Jan 10, 2017</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Torchler\">Torchler</a>","created_at":"2017-01-11T00:34:28Z"}]}
