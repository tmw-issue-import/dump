However after I blow them up it takes solid 2 seconds for the icon to realize that the mushrooms are gone, even though it has already started the cooldown timer on Bloom. Also when it finally does switch, it doesn't show the numerical timer, just the sweep. (The timer text is only enabled on the icon for 0 mushrooms, which is the icon the meta switches to after the icon for 3 mushrooms hides.)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/616\">#616</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/616.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-10-18T06:00:27Z","created_at":"2012-09-14T14:01:23Z","updated_at":"2012-10-18T06:00:27Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The delay is on Blizzard's side of things.
