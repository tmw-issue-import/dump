{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1204] How to track Lifebloom on 2 different targets with 4 pice HFC Druid Tier set ","body":" <p>Hi.. I am a Resto Druid with the 4 Piece T18 set.&nbsp; I am trying to track my 2 lifeblooms expirations on different targets since I can put 2 lifeblooms simultaneously on different targets.&nbsp; I want my voice-over sound notification to fire off on Finish of the 1st lifebloom and at the same time on finish of the second lifebloom so I know when to reapply it.... How do I go about that? I am not very experienced with the addon.. Thanks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Darlok9\">Darlok9</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1204\">#1204</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1204.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-04-30T16:35:48Z","created_at":"2016-04-29T07:13:04Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T16:35:48Z","labels":["duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Already responded on Curse.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-04-30T16:35:39Z"}]}
