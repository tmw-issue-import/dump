A couple icons I would like to improve in my set.</p><p>1. Bloop Tap: Icon works great (Shows when stacks&gt;5 to be usable and when there is a rune to fill it with), but I'm not sure how to set it up so that it shows a global cooldown like a normal ability. The issue is that it is actually tracking \"Blood Charge\" so that it shows the stack count of that buff and GCD's seem to just be for usable actions.</p><p>^1^T^SStackMinEnabled^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SRunes^T ^N1^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^t^N2^T ^SRunes^T ^N2^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N3^T ^SRunes^T ^N5^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N4^T ^SRunes^T ^N6^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N5^T ^SRunes^T ^N3^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N6^T ^SRunes^T ^N4^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^Sn^N6 ^t^SStackMin^N5 ^SName^SBlood~`Charge ^SClockGCD^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^S,K[+i/dB&amp;KgX ^STexts^T ^N1^S6 ^N2^S ^N4^S[Stacks] ^t^t^t^SCustomTex^S114851 ^SFakeHidden^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^N60414^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>And last, no clue on this one so any help would be appreciated. On my blood DK, a couple of mop dungeons have undead that I like to \"Control Undead\" on for the majority of the instance and drag around as my pet. Because things go nasty if they \"go free\" during a fight and go right for the healer etc. I have learned to dismiss and re-control them between fights. Control Undead is supposed to last 5 min so I would love an icon that will only show up when I have a pet and that will show a timer for how long I have had it or a countdown from 5 min when Control Undead is used etc. You get the idea.<br>On the same note, an icon that shows when I lose a pet so that I can set it to really warn me if this happens (icon shake etc). Its obviously not something I want on my screen often (like when a hunter does not have a pet, but rather the loss of a controlled pet) since I seldom control undead. Not sure if that one is possible.</p><p>ATM this is my control undead. Just checks for \"undead\" target and no current pet.</p><p>^1^T^SStackMinEnabled^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SRunes^T ^N1^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^t^N2^T ^SRunes^T ^N2^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N3^T ^SRunes^T ^N5^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N4^T ^SRunes^T ^N6^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N5^T ^SRunes^T ^N3^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N6^T ^SRunes^T ^N4^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^Sn^N6 ^t^SStackMin^N5 ^SName^SBlood~`Charge ^SClockGCD^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^S,K[+i/dB&amp;KgX ^STexts^T ^N1^S6 ^N2^S ^N4^S[Stacks] ^t^t^t^SCustomTex^S114851 ^SFakeHidden^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^N60414^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>Thanks so much!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Maven79\">Maven79</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/656\">#656</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/656.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-10-26T04:14:02Z","created_at":"2012-10-06T16:27:18Z","updated_at":"2012-10-26T04:14:02Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>1) Setup a cooldown icon for Blood Tap, add an Icon Shown condition to it that checks your Blood Charge icon, and set the stack text on the Blood Tap icon to <code>[Stacks(group=1, icon=1)]</code>, replacing the groupID and iconID in it match those of the Blood Charge icon.</p>\r\n<p>2) The string you gave is the same as the first one.
