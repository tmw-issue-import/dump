{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1096] Bodyguard check ","body":" <p>Any way to check if you are missing your barracks bodyguard (follower trait)? It does not seem to provide any trackable buff that I could find and I know they are a little unusual in how they behave. But if I let mine die, I so often can forget to re-summon them for a day or two.</p><p>Thanks!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1096\">#1096</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1096.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-03-06T02:05:09Z","created_at":"2015-03-04T18:33:18Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T13:09:26Z","labels":["declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>No, there is no way to determine this.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-03-06T02:04:46Z"},{"body":" <p>Just FYI for others, but not news to you since you added the buff to the add on thankfully, what I ended up doing was just checking for the Bodyguard Miniaturization Device (122298) buff. Not exactly accurate, but assuming someone always keep this buff active like I do, I've found it works quite well until blizz makes a change for bodyguards.
