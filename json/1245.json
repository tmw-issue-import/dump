It appears to be more or less a boolean of \"imps are summoned\" or \"imps are not summoned\".</p>\r\n<p>To see it in action just make a \"totem\" icon type and track \"Totem 1\" Repeat for totem 2 and 3 then go do your rotation on a dummy and it will quickly make sense how the game handles them all.</p>\r\n<p>The most robust demonology pet tracker I heard about, called \"zpets\", is just a mass of timers and monitoring for summon, death events. That many loops I saw in its code made me not want to demo it, so I can't say how it works <span>:)</span></p>\r\n<p>I would assume you can make some fairly complicated timers in TMW to basically check for when you cast Hand, how many soul shards you have, set a timer for their duration. etc. but as Cy said, it would be based on variables and math and not on actual game variables for imp counts, which are buffed etc. I did something much simpler to flag Demonic Empowerment timers after casting any summon pet spell but that was about as far as my brain could stretch.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a>","created_at":"2016-08-04T17:50:25Z"},{"body":" <p>Finally got around to this.

I dont mind thisv ery much but I can see this getting a bit confusing at times</p>\r\n<p>2-) Is there a possibility to include the demons summoned by the talent Grimoire of Service? i was trying to do this by adding the Felguard(NPCID:17252) of the Grimoire: Felguard (SpellID:) but it doesnt pick it up</p>\r\n<p>3-) This is not strictly related to the Guardians Icon, but rather general information, is it possible to know the Cast Time of certain spells? to know if I coul get a cast off before a certain buff/debuff fades one example for this is Thal'kiel's Consumption or Marksman Hunter, Marksman gameplay resolves arround getting as much Aimed Shots during a Vulnerability(6s debuff) window and then, before the debuff expires, firing off a Marked Shot, since Aimed Shot has cast time and this is modified by haste procs/herosim, i was wondering if it would be possible to compare the actual cast time of an ability, to a buff/debuff to know if this would alow me to cast it right away or if I fucked up and might as well hold on using the following ability (Thal'kiel's Consumption also applies to this, comparing if the Guardian's icon closest to expire is longer than Thal'kiel's Consumption cast time)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mickuchiharogue\">Mickuchiharogue</a>","created_at":"2016-10-05T01:04:43Z"}]}
