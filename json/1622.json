It can also be stuck in the reverse way. Does not fix itself until either it does randomly or I reload. I feel like it has something to do with instancing within an area, as it'll happen after a flight path or something.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've changed the conditionals since then (can post what I currently use if you want).
