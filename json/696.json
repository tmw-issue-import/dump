As a general rule of thumb, you should always check buffs and debuffs by their name instead of by their ID unless there is a specific reason why you need to track a specific ID of a spell (to distinguish between different spells with the same name)</p>\r\n<p>Just change the spellID (122351) to the spell name (Molten Core) and you should be good to go.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-11-14T17:58:18Z"},{"body":" <p>I am going to close this ticket now.
