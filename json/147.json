Not sure if you changed anything in this latest version that could be messing with the frames in a way that it confuses the kong addon.</p><p>Also for the sake of brevity I only listed the first 10 frames in the list but a lot more appear in the error message.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Beruchan\">Beruchan</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/147\">#147</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/147.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-03-31T21:25:38Z","created_at":"2011-03-29T00:39:56Z","updated_at":"2011-03-31T21:25:38Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I'll see about fixing it, but this is as much a problem with Kong UI Hider as it is a problem with TMW.
