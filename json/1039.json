{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1039] Request a new feature: distinguish whether an unusable rune is refreshing or locked ","body":" <p>Thanks a lot for your amazing addon. It helps me much in the game.</p><p>The TMW is able to identify whether a rune is usable or not, but it seems that the TMW cannot distinguish whether an unusable rune is refreshing or locked.</p><p>Is that possible to add such status, which are usable, refreshing and locked, rather than usable and unusable?</p><p>The reason why this function is important for me is the Blood tape talent. To fully use its value, a locked blood/frost/unholy should be refreshed and turned into a death rune. But if a locked death rune is refreshed by the blood tap, part of the value is wasted.</p><p>For example, we have a pair of unusable blood runes, one of them is a blood rune, the other one is a death rune in blood rune position. The blood rune is expected to be refreshed, but only if this rune is locked, the blood tap should be used.</p><p>Many thanks for your time.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/WarBringerC\">WarBringerC</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1039\">#1039</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1039.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-12-20T00:39:21Z","created_at":"2014-12-01T03:18:41Z","updated_at":"2014-12-20T00:39:21Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added 2 more rune conditions in g3ea71b2.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-12-20T00:39:14Z"}]}
