{"issue":{"title":"[CF 972] Icon Activation Border buggy since latest beta build ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create an icon with Notification Animation Icon: Activation Border<br>2. Whenever the conditions are met the Activation Border will trigger in a buggy way<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>Expected is normal Blizzard-like Activation Border. Instead the effect appears to \"double\" in a way - border lights up as expected but also a magnified overlay of the effect appears for ~0.2sec that is distracting and obstructive. This effect also seems to trigger on \"Always Hidden\" icons for no apparent reason.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?

It starts big and then shrinks to fit the size of the icon. Perhaps you had another addon that was modifying the Blizzard version of the effect.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 21 2014 19:48:28 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1405990108\">Jul 21, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-07-22T00:45:34Z"},{"body":" <p>Yes, this is indeed the Blizzard effect (starts zoomed, then zooms in on the icon).<br>\r\nI've confirmed that this issue happens with all other addons disabled.<br>\r\nAfter looking into this a bit more, it seems that the issue only happens if the effect is fired when it is already used on at least one other icon. The first time animation will be correct and smooth while on subsequent icons the animation will be buggy. I've attached a screenshot of how the buggy animation looks in the middle of firing.<br>\r\nCreated a profile that consists of 2 icons which check target range and fire animation when getting 10yds or nearer and 11yds or nearer respectively. So simply approaching target at steady speed should show the bug.<br>\r\nProfile string:<br>\r\n^1^T^SGroups^T ^N1^T ^SPoint^T ^Sy^F8006426255658152 ^f-51^Sx ^F-8694453162679352^f-47 ^t^SIcons^T ^N1^T ^SType^Sconditionicon ^SUnAlpha^N0.5 ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SAnimation^SACTVTNGLOW ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SInfinite^B ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N15 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SAnimation^SICONCLEAR ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&gt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N16 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SShowWhen^N3 ^SEnabled^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N15 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^Sconditionicon ^SUnAlpha^N0.5 ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SAnimation^SACTVTNGLOW ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SInfinite^B ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N10 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SAnimation^SICONCLEAR ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&gt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N11 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SShowWhen^N3 ^SEnabled^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N15 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^t^SGUID^STMW:group:1JpRugUOt5ic ^t^t^SVersion^N70305 ^t^N70305^S~`~| ^Sprofile^SDEBUG ^^</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 21 2014 20:54:59 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1405994099\">Jul 21, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/erict\">erict</a>","created_at":"2014-07-22T01:48:44Z"},{"body":" <p>Ok, thanks, I'll check it out.</p>\r\n<p>Edit: Yep, definitely bugged.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 21 2014 21:06:52 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1405994812\">Jul 21, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-07-22T02:05:02Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks for the report.
