{"issue":{"title":"[CF 57] Increase the number of conditions to 4+ ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?</p><p>To add more conditions than 3.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>Thanks for updating my favorite addon! With the conditions, it can actually compete with Power Auras, which used to be monopolist in complex conditions. The problem is, with my Mage I ran out of space conditions-wise.</p><p>I wanted to Deep Freeze to show when:<br>Frost Nova is present on target OR<br>Freeze is present on target OR<br>Improved Cone of Cold is present on target OR<br>Fingers of Frost is present on player.</p><p>this is 4 conditions, so it can't be executed. Of course there are ways around it, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like more than 3 conditions.</p><p>Keep up the good work!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/f1reburn\">f1reburn</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/57\">#57</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/57.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-08T22:28:36Z","created_at":"2010-12-05T19:30:56Z","updated_at":"2010-12-08T22:28:36Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The number of conditions can already be adjusted up to 10.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/pages/guide/#w-main-options\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/pages/guide/#w-main-options</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-12-05T22:34:48Z"}]}
