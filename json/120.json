{"issue":{"title":"[CF 120] Wish: add condition \"item equipped\" ","body":" <p>I'm showing certain item cooldowns (e.g. trinkets) with TMW. Those icons are shown if the trinket can be used (mana reg). It would be nice if I could attach a condition to the item that enables the item only if a certain item is equipped -- not necessarily the one the item's name refers to though.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
