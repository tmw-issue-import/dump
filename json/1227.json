{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1227] \"Overcooldown\" Tracking ","body":" <p>Hello,</p><p>I would love to have a new timer implemented for TMW which starts a timer when the ability or item has come OFF cooldown (is usable). This would be really useful for assisting judgement in delaying some ability usages (longer ones especially) so that you can use them more impactfully at certain points in an encounter, while showing you also if you delayed it so much that you lost an ability usage. At the moment this is usually only possible to evaluate in logs or after extensive familiarity with an encounter.</p><p>After the encounter is over (combat is dropped), it would be really nice to have the overcooldown timer freeze like a stopwatch, and also display the cumulative overcooldown time elapsed over the fight.</p><p>Thanks for all your amazing work with this addon!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BicVelleda\">BicVelleda</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1227\">#1227</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1227.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-08-15T00:23:40Z","created_at":"2016-07-15T12:37:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T00:23:40Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You already can do this. Make an icon to track that cooldown, and add two Timer notifications to the icon. One with an On Start trigger that will reset the timer, and one with an On Finish trigger that will start the timer. Then, use the [Timer] DogTag to display the value of your timer.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-16T05:38:15Z"}]}
