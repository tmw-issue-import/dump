{"issue":{"title":"[CF 302] Streamline importing ","body":" <p>Marenwynn said<br>Monday, October 03, 2011 10:21:19 PM (2 days ago)</p><p>Thank you so much! This is most excellent. :D</p><p>Would it be possible to put import fields under the interface options for TMW, though? It is not really a problem the way the import works now, but it seems awkward to import profiles or groups through the icon configuration screen. I think it would seem more intuitive to import entire profiles under \"Profiles\" or \"Main Options,\" and groups through \"+ Add Another Group +.\" But whatever works. =P</p><p>Anyway, thanks again for this and for all the work you've done on TMW. :) I can't raid without it! Also, if you need a video demonstration to show some of the endless possibilities of the addon to people, I uploaded a video at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwhljoUbMro\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwhljoUbMro</a> of my profile in raid, with a link to the import string. ^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/302\">#302</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/302.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-10-14T22:58:13Z","created_at":"2011-10-07T01:39:45Z","updated_at":"2011-10-14T22:58:13Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
