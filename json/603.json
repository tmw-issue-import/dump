{"issue":{"title":"[CF 603] Combustion Trigger Icon ","body":" <p>Hi, I would like TMW to display an Icon for Combustion when a previous spell hits a certain miminum critical.&nbsp; Here is what is suggested as&nbsp; an ideal time to use Combustion:</p><p> Always use Combustion after landing a big critical hit (or a series thereof) with&nbsp; Pyroblast (doing so with&nbsp; Fireball is also viable).</p><p>Can you provide some guidance as to how to create an icon that will notify my when a previous spell hit a minimum crit - thank You?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Iannet\">Iannet</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/603\">#603</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/603.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-19T03:04:02Z","created_at":"2012-09-10T14:04:18Z","updated_at":"2012-09-19T03:04:02Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I prefer using CombustionHelper for this, and I couldn't find a way to have TMW observe crits. If you insist on using TMW, this is my best suggestion :P It observes the ignite debuff value, but it has no minimum value (I couldn't figure out a way to set that). Instead it works with the other icon and only shows, when there has been a pyroblast or fireball crit.</p>\r\n<p>It's a stand alone group, import through the import field, from string.

TMW has been my mainstay tool for over 1 year. I know other tools do certain things - they just are not as clean and detailed. I am using combustion helper and will try to make that work for me if this doesn't do the trick and thank you.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Iannet\">Iannet</a>","created_at":"2012-09-10T19:10:15Z"},{"body":" <p>Use the minimum stack setting (on the right-hand side of the icon editor, main tab) to set a minimum ignite damage for the icon to show. The editbox isn't visually friendly with large values, but I can assure you they will fit.
