Currently I only see a way to monitor if runes are either usable (full) or not usable (not full). While a recharging or depleted rune both count as \"not usable\" in terms of using a rune-costing ability, the difference matters with blood tap being usable or not. Would it be possibly to add another state to differentiate empty from recharging to the rune resource condition?</p><p>Thanks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Maven79\">Maven79</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/657\">#657</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/657.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-10-26T04:29:09Z","created_at":"2012-10-07T14:35:55Z","updated_at":"2012-10-26T04:29:13Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Can you check for a fully-depleted rune just by checking of both runes of a single type aren't usable?</p>\r\n<p>Something like this:</p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SCustomTex^S45529 ^SEnabled^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SRunes^T ^N1^b ^N2^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^t^N2^T ^SRunes^T ^N5^b ^N6^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N3^T ^SRunes^T ^N3^b ^N4^b ^t^SType^SRUNES ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^Sn^N3 ^t^t^N60416^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-10-12T04:28:06Z"},{"body":" <p>This works perfectly.
