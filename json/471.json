{"issue":{"title":"[CF 471] Allow any sound channel ","body":" <p>_Klut<br>_Klut's avatar</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Posts: 7</p><p>Cybeloras, I want to thank you for this addon and your support.</p><p>I've got an idea which is an improvement to TellMeWhen. It would be nice if I could set the sound output volume directly to master or sound (and maybe to music and environment, too). In the moment I'm still overhearing the sound notification, as the playback volume of the selected/added sound file is the same as all the other sound effects in the game.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Spam<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Spam<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Edit<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Delete<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Report<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote</p><p>Posted &lt; 1 minute ago #1874<br>Cybeloras<br>Cybeloras's avatar</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Posts: 771</p><p>Switches between master and sfx channels already exist, althought a little ghetto in their implementation. Checking the 'Always play sound\" option in TMW's main options will use the master channel, unchecking it will use the sfx channel. Music and environment channels are currently unused by TMW, but I will consider imeplementing them in the future.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tellmewhen#c1873\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tellmewhen#c1873</a></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/471\">#471</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/471.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-02T01:29:35Z","created_at":"2012-03-20T21:31:06Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T01:29:35Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
