{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1592] LUA to disable opening chat while in an arena? ","body":" <p>I'm shit with LUA - is it possible to add a LUA conditional alongside with a player combat=true + instance type=arena to disable the opening of the chat box while the icon succeeds as true?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Basically the following image (icon type is a condition icon). I've never used the LUA conditional so if it has to be standalone I could just move the combat/instance conditions to group conditions and have it be a standalone icon.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u1bqz59.jpg\"></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1592\">#1592</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1592.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-25T00:57:32Z","created_at":"2018-10-08T21:29:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T00:57:32Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Lua conditions should be a statement that evaluates to a boolean, and they should have no side effects.&nbsp; What you're asking for would fulfill neither of those.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Something like this, if you want to do it inside of TMW, would need to be written as a standalone code snippet.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-10-10T00:24:37Z"},{"body":" <p>Yea after I posted I realized that it wouldn't make sense for boolean conditionals to then take that LUA condition and execute it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If it was made as a snippet, how would I do that (as in the code for it)?
