It really is an ugly way to go about filtering units, and would be much better accomplished by implementing real filters to units somehow. TMW's framework for handling units is already quite solid, so I should be able to expand upon it and add unit filters. Hopefully these filters will actually be conditions, using the condition interface, but be tied to units rather than icons.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-06T02:36:37Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20490%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20490%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>Does that mean the functionality would be lost?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-05-06T19:04:35Z"},{"body":" <p>It is lost right now, but I will see what I can do in getting it back in as quick as I can.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that I am, unfortunately, beginning to lose interest in WoW, and I don't really feel the same motivation to work on TMW as I used to. That does not mean that I am going to abandon it any time soon - at the very least I am going to fix all of the problems that it has right now and complete all of the open tickets. I just want to start to slow down and stop developing every feature request I get.</p>\r\n<p>At some point, I do need to shift the focus of my life to other things, and it is starting to feel like this weekend has been a seminal moment in my life (but enough on my personal life). If anything, my work on TMW is going to pick up over the next few days to keep my mind off some things (Grrr, I thought I said that was enough of my personal life. Now it is, I promise)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-06T19:22:12Z"},{"body":" <p>Well right now almost everybody is loosing interest in WoW, everybody is pretty much fed up with Dragonsoul and there's barely anything to do until MoP comes outs. If anything this is one of the few addons that's getting any mayor development at the moment, so thanks for that. Most likely things will pick up for addon development once the MoP beta clients allows addons.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Beruchan\">Beruchan</a>","created_at":"2012-05-06T21:25:08Z"},{"body":" <p>Current plan is to implement a form of conditions for units. Each unit that an icon checks must, if such conditions are defined for the units, pass these conditions to be considered for evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>So, you would be able to check over a whole raid and only search for, say units who are in range, have less than 40% health, do not have power word shield active, and do not have the weakened soul debuff.</p>\r\n<p>That's the plan, anyway.
