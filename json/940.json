Loading the UI<br>2.<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>I uh, expect it to load...</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>6.2.6</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>No</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>I stick the addond into the folder, load in, and i get \"Loading TellMeWhen_Options could not be loaded: Missing\" four times in a row. The only thing I can think of is that when I'm copying the files over, I get a notice that the folder already exists and it asks if I want to Copy and Replace etc. I've tried all three options and it still doesn't work.

Also make sure that both TellMeWhen and TellMeWhen_Options are present in your Interface/AddOns directory. If you are still having trouble after this, try installing using the Curse Client.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from this, I can't offer much other advice because this is an issue with the way that you are installing your addons and not an issue with TellMeWhen itself.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-04-13T17:36:54Z"}]}
