{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1168] Can't get unit speed to work ","body":" <p>I am trying to make an event condition for Sniper Training (MM hunter ability) that only triggers if the duration is less than 3.5 seconds AND I am moving.</p><p>So far I have this</p><p>Buff duration / player / &lt;= 3.5 seconds - buff sniper training - only cast by me</p><p>Also I have tried Unit Speed / player &gt; 0</p><p>Now the problem is no matter what I set for unit speed or how I move it up or down the ocnditionals, it fires wrong.</p><p>I do not want the trigger to fire (a text notification) if I stop moving before the buff duration falls below 3.5 seconds but to trigger if I am still moving at &lt; 3.5 seconds.</p><p>Currently it will trigger the text notification even if I stop moving before that 3.5 seconds is up.</p><p>I can't get this. I can either get it to work if I am standing still and it hits &lt; 3.5 seconds or trigger as soon as the buff duration starts ticking.</p><p>I even tried adding a condition for sniper training: recently moved but it won't work.</p><p>so in summary, I want the event conditional for the hunter buff Sniper Training to only fire a text message IF I am moving AND the duration is less than 3.5 seconds. If it is greater than 3.5 seconds and i am not moving DO NOT trigger.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/transitbus\">transitbus</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1168\">#1168</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1168.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-10-10T22:41:45Z","created_at":"2015-10-10T21:18:43Z","updated_at":"2015-10-10T22:41:45Z","labels":["invalid"]},"comments":[]}
