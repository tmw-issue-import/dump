To allow it to continue to run down even once the duration is zero, I would have to keep the old duration and start time, but there would be no way to detect when an icon changes from one thing to another with a duration of zero without a bunch more code taking up precious CPU cycles, so the rate of decay would end up looking really weird when things change, and I would have to tax people with extra CPU usage that they aren't getting anything out of.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-05-07T00:44:18Z"}]}
