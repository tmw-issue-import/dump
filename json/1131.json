{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1131] Question about player spell caching ","body":" <p>I'm in the process of making an addon, and while looking through TMW's code (which I've learned a ton from!) I noticed you had a \"Cache\" table in TellMeWhen &gt; Components &gt; Core &gt; Spells &gt; ClassSpellCache.lua that seems to contain every spell ID for each class. I've tried so many different ways of trying to parse through spell IDs hunting for the relevant ones to generate a table like that, but I haven't been able to filter it down to less than 3,500 entries. That leaves me with tons of junk spell IDs that I don't care about. I just wanted to ask how you made that table? Do you have some way to generate it to easily keep it updated, or do you have to do it manually?</p><p>Also, do you mind if I use any of your code, like this table, in my own project? I would credit you for it of course.</p><p>Sorry for this not being a proper ticket about TMW! I couldn't think of a better way to contact you. As always, thanks for managing such an awesome addon!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Pip646\">Pip646</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1131\">#1131</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1131.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-06-16T18:51:35Z","created_at":"2015-06-08T18:59:18Z","updated_at":"2015-06-16T18:51:35Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You're welcome to use it as long as the license of your project is compatible with the GNU GPL v3.</p>\r\n<p>The data in that file is generated using this script, which scrapes WowHead: <a href=\"https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/blob/master/Scripts/GetCSC.lua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/blob/master/Scripts/GetCSC.lua</a></p>\r\n<p>It requires LuaSockets (<a href=\"http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket</a>) and the json library that comes with the Lua Windows install package.
