When I set the icon to Reactive Ability and set the spell to track as Dark Simulacrum, it shows it when I'm able to use it. However, I need it to only show when my enemy casts a spell with the debuff on. So I tried setting conditions to Debuff Duration&gt;Dark Simulacrum&gt;Target&gt;Greater than Absent combined with Spell Cast&gt;(track all)&gt;Target&gt;Present. Ive also tried it with Spell Cast&gt;(track all)&gt;Target&gt;Absent and Spell Cast&gt;(track all)&gt;Target&gt;Interruptible, but nothing seems to work. I've also tried Spell Cast&gt;(track all)&gt;Target&gt;(present, absent, or interruptible) by itself. Nothing seems to work.</p><p>^1^T^SPoint^T ^Sy^F-6385076557130012 ^f-46^Sx ^F-8496163789155770^f-46 ^t^SScale^F7578024062666011 ^f-52^SLocked ^B^SEnabled ^B^SColumns ^N1^SIcons ^T^N1^T ^SDurationMin^N1 ^SType^Smultistate ^SUnAlpha^N0 ^SAlpha^N0 ^SShowTimerText^B ^SName^SDark~`Simulacrum ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SSound ^SSound^SShort~`Circuit ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N2^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SAnimation^SICONALPHAFLASH ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N3^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SDuration^N1.5 ^SAnimation^SACTVTNGLOW ^SEvent^SOnStart ^t^N4^T ^Sr_anim^F5298352502788819 ^f-53^SType ^SAnimations^Sb_anim ^F8336074604387742^f-54 ^Sg_anim^F6499312403420951 ^f-56^SDuration ^N5^SThickness ^N12^SAnimation ^SICONBORDER^SAnchorTo ^SIconModule_IconContainer_MasqueIconContainer^SEvent ^SOnShow^SPeriod ^N0.7^t ^Sn^N4 ^t^SShowWhen^N0 ^SShowTimer^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^t^SName^SDark~`Simulacrum ^t^N62602^S~`~| ^Sgroup^N21 ^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Laxativesqt\">Laxativesqt</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/906\">#906</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/906.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-01-23T18:14:48Z","created_at":"2014-01-07T11:36:26Z","updated_at":"2014-01-23T18:14:48Z","labels":["declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Both of that icon's Show States have been disabled, so that icon will never be visible.</p>\r\n<p>This is what you described to me:</p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SDark~`Simulacrum ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCASTING ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N1 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SEnabled^B ^SUnit^Starget ^t^N70044^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that once someone casts a spell, the debuff is removed, so this icon will only ever be visible when you cast Dark Sim on someone who is already casting. Since that is pretty pointless, I'm not quite sure what you are wanting here, but I will take a guess that what you are looking for is an icon that will show you what spell you can cast once you have stolen one. To do this, set up a simple Multi-state cooldown icon with no other conditions: </p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Smultistate ^SUnAlpha^N0.5 ^SShowWhen^Salways ^SShowTimerText^B ^SEnabled^B ^SName^SDark~`Simulacrum ^t^N47301^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 8 2014 18:37:41 (CDT) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1389227861\">Jan 8, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-01-09T00:27:16Z"},{"body":" <p>No response after two weeks.
