{"issue":{"title":"[CF 418] Swap, Import not working on a reset icon ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create an icon (see below for an icon that should work)<br>2. Go on an empty icon and press the reset button then okay<br>3. Try and import the icon on this empty spot and it will create the icon but everything that was typed in will be missing (Watcher, Custom Texture, Stacks and duration will be reset to default)</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>The icon to be copied or imported properly</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>4.7.3</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p><p>The problem doesn't seem to happen all the time. If you copy a working icon over the faulty Empty Box you can fix the issue until you reset it again and some other time copying the icon won't fix the issue.</p><p>Stolen Time - Mage T13 Set Bonus<br>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SConditionAlpha^N0.75 ^SStackMinEnabled^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SEvents^T ^SOnStack^T ^Sg^F4521260802379792 ^f-57^SSound ^STMW~`-~`Pling~`4^Sr ^N0^SText ^S%s~`is~`at~`%k~`stacks~`!^SChannel ^SFRAME^SLocation ^SRaidWarningFrame^t ^SOnAlphaInc^T ^Sr_anim^F4521260802379792 ^f-58^SSound ^SSound\\Creature\\WarmasterBlackhorn\\VO_DS_Blackhorn_Spell_02.ogg^Sg_anim ^F6781891203569688^f-57 ^SAnimation^SSCREENFLASH ^Sb_anim^N1 ^t^t^SCustomTex^S105785 ^SShowTimerText^B ^SEnabled^B ^SStackMin^N10 ^SName^S105785 ^t^N47322^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/InfernalAura\">InfernalAura</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/418\">#418</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/418.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-01-09T05:36:29Z","created_at":"2012-01-09T02:46:25Z","updated_at":"2012-01-09T05:36:29Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Does the problem persist when using the latest alpha version (current r408)?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-09T03:07:59Z"},{"body":" <p>Hehe sorry for the false alarm ...
