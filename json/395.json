Create a Lightwell Icon in TellMeWhen<br>3. Drop a Lightwell<br>4. Icon will show 10 charge while it has 15</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>The stack number to be 15.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>4.7.2</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>This problem is probably out of scope of the addon since it's probably not meant to scan player's glyph for this kind of stuff but would it be possible to get a check box that you check if it's glyph so it count from 15 stack instead of 10 stacks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/InfernalAura\">InfernalAura</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/395\">#395</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/395.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-12-25T03:35:16Z","created_at":"2011-12-24T04:36:27Z","updated_at":"2011-12-25T03:35:16Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It does scan for the glyph, and in my testing, it was working fine.
