{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1452] Lightforged Warframe ","body":" <p>Wanted a large icon in the game field to track the uptime of my Lightforged Warframe on Argus. Got the icon to appear, but it displays no (duration) timer, yes Omni is installed and all my other various timers work just fine. Remember a while back some things did not get picked up and tracked by Omini, so there was a syntax to force a time to be shown for a known duration. What I remember is adding something like \":45\" to the end of it's name. I know that does NOT work, so maybe I have something wrong (the item, when called, has a 45 second duration)?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BrightBrown\">BrightBrown</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1452\">#1452</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1452.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-01-20T21:09:20Z","created_at":"2017-12-21T03:54:42Z","updated_at":"2018-01-21T15:42:13Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The buff technically isn't on you, its on the warframe, which counts as your pet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, track \"Lightforged Warframe Activated\" on unit \"pet\" and this should work just fine.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-01-20T21:09:20Z"},{"body":" <p>Thanks so much... that solves the issue!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BrightBrown\">BrightBrown</a>","created_at":"2018-01-21T15:42:13Z"}]}
