{"issue":{"title":"[CF 966] Condition \"Unit Level\" not showing a number. ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Subsequently, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Backup\". Select the \"To string\" option for the appropriate export type (icon, group, or profile), and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS WILL RESULT IN YOUR TICKET BEING INVALIDATED.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create an icon<br>2. Set a condition with Unit Attributes -&gt; Unit Level<br>3. Drag the slider to change level</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>Earlier, I got a numerical value (or the \"Boss\" indication if the slider was all the way to the left) but now nothing shows except the \"Boss\" indication working as normal.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>7.0.1</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>Nope.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>This is just one of many icons I use with the Unit Level condition. I create a LOT of alts, so I want my profiles to be interchangable and not show Icons a low level char does not have access to.</p><p>^1^T^SType^Scast ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SREACT ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N1 ^t^N2^T ^SType^SSPELLCD ^SName^SPummel ^t^N3^T ^SType^SLEVEL ^SOperator^S&gt;= ^SLevel^N15 ^t^Sn^N3 ^t^SInterruptible^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^STMW:textlayout:,]sUJ]m&amp;ZR)6 ^STexts^T ^N1^S[Spell] ^N2^SQ ^t^t^t^SEnabled^B ^SUnit^Starget ^t^N70103^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>^1 ^T^N1^T ^SAnchors^T ^N2^T ^Sy^N15 ^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SStringName^SBinding/Label ^SSkinAs^SHotKey ^SSize^N6 ^t^N2^T ^SAnchors^T ^N1^T ^Sy^N2 ^Sx^N-2 ^Spoint^SBOTTOMRIGHT ^SrelativePoint^SBOTTOMRIGHT ^t^t^SStringName^SStacks ^SDefaultText^S[Stacks:Hide(0)] ^SSkinAs^SCount ^SSize^N6 ^t^SName^SIcon~`Magnuz~`(From:~`Jorunn~`-~`Frostmane) ^Sn^N2 ^SGUID^STMW:textlayout:,]sUJ]m&amp;ZR)6 ^t^N70103^S~`~| ^Stextlayout^STMW:textlayout:,]sUJ]m&amp;ZR)6 ^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Archont1978\">Archont1978</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/966\">#966</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/966.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-07-11T20:25:34Z","created_at":"2014-07-11T11:04:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T20:25:34Z","labels":["defect","duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p><a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20958%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/958-unit-level-conditional-doesnt-report-value/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-07-11T20:25:26Z"}]}
