{"issue":{"title":"[CF 769] Entering combat while moving a group doesn't release the mouse ","body":" <p>I have TMW set to not allow config in combat.&nbsp; When I enter combat, it turns off config mode.&nbsp; All well and good for fiddling with my UI while riding around on the isle of thunder, except when I'm in the middle of mouse-dragging a group when I enter combat.&nbsp; Then I can't mouselook while in combat, and probably other mouse stuff not working either.&nbsp; Leaving combat and doing /tmw, the group was still dragging with the mouse, but clicking mouse buttons didn't let go of it.</p><p> Fixed with /reload; icon group was back to where it was, was able to move it just fine while not running near hostile mobs.&nbsp; Just glad that combat was one I wanted to run away from anyway :P</p><p> This was with v6.1.6 r721.&nbsp; If this isn't easily reproducible, I can post more details, like my full config settings and my icons or w/e you need.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Karsteck\">Karsteck</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/769\">#769</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/769.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-03-18T18:51:56Z","created_at":"2013-03-18T17:28:04Z","updated_at":"2013-03-18T18:51:56Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
