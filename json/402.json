{"issue":{"title":"[CF 402] Weapon Enchant Icon doesn't properly update ","body":" <p>I've noticed while twinking rogue and shaman, where I use Tmw to alert me to reapply poisons or earthliving weapon, that Tmw does not immediately update when I use those abilities. I have to un- and reequip them, or enchant them a second time to get the icon to update. A minor annoyance, but still.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/402\">#402</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/402.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-01-06T22:52:04Z","created_at":"2011-12-29T12:04:51Z","updated_at":"2012-01-06T22:52:04Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Yeah, Weapon Enchant Icon have some problem in zhCN &amp; zhTW client too.<br>\r\nBeacuse in zhTW client that name show on tooltip is same as spell name,&nbsp;&nbsp;the suggestions list will miss that WEAPON word, like 'earthliving weapon' it's show on tootip is \"大地生命武器\", but suggestions list show that name is '大地生命' (earthliving), don't have word 'weapon'. this error is zhTW client ONLY.</p>\r\n<p>In zhCN client, if you type or select weapon enchant name to editbox, icon couldn't work, i think that parentheses are double byte charactor '（）' on that weapon tooltip make this happened.</p>\r\n<p>Sorry for my bad english! :D</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"12 29 2011 07:19:37 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1325164777\">Dec 29, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lsjyzjl\">lsjyzjl</a>","created_at":"2011-12-29T13:17:24Z"},{"body":" <p>The suggestion list for weapon enchants uses hacks that should never be spoken of.
