{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1166] Monitor \"snapshoted\" Bleeds ","body":" <p>Let me preface this by saying that TMW works wonders for me and i can`t imagine playing the game without this addon anymore :)<br>I know this suggestion already came up a while ago, but i couldn`t find it anymore and don`t know if this was taken care of or if it was declined for some reason.</p><p>I would really like to have a feature in TMW that gives me a way to distinguish between snapshoted bleeds and \"normal\" applied bleeds.<br>As far as i know, there is currently no way to monitor feral bleeds that are improved due to bloodtalons or tigers fury for example.</p><p>Thanks for reading this and i would very much appreciate your feedback on this issue. :)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/KingZer081\">KingZer081</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1166\">#1166</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1166.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-10-03T18:25:58Z","created_at":"2015-10-02T13:20:56Z","updated_at":"2015-10-03T18:25:58Z","labels":["enhancement","duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p><a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201061%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/1061-implment-some-way-to-track-feral-dot-strength/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-10-03T18:25:49Z"}]}
