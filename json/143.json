{"issue":{"title":"[CF 143] 3rd option for alpha \"5\" or \"x\" secs before CD is over ","body":" <p>Request:<br>I use TMW to track cooldowns obviously. I'd like to request an option to show icon at 5 sec or less for cooldown to expire.<br>Right now the only two option I can find is to show it on cooldown or ready or both. There are some long CD spells, that I dont want to see when they still have over 1 min on CD, but would like to know when there is only 5 secs remaining so I can get ready to use them. If you want to go further you could make it user configurable what time the CD icon should start to show, but if that is too much work, just stick with 5sec, should, that should be okay for most users.<br>Yes I know I can set visibility lower for time on CD and time ready, but its not the same thing. I hope you get my point. There are so many things to pay attention to in a serious arena match and we have to use our visual cue most of the time. If I have to look at CD (of for example trinket) all the time its not efficient. However if you implement the above, then I will only see (from the corner of my eye) the Icon pop-up, so I can know that I am 5 secs away from being able to use it.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/oalex\">oalex</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/143\">#143</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/143.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-03-21T01:44:05Z","created_at":"2011-03-20T20:01:07Z","updated_at":"2011-03-21T16:44:21Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Such an option already exists. </p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-03-21T01:41:02Z"},{"body":" <p>I cant find it, plz help</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/oalex\">oalex</a>","created_at":"2011-03-21T16:36:05Z"},{"body":" <p>never mind, found it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/oalex\">oalex</a>","created_at":"2011-03-21T16:44:21Z"}]}
