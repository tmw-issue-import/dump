I can't imagine why, as DKs have existed since 3.0 (as has the rune API), and when I delete the rune API, there are no errors that occur. It may be some other issue that is occuring.</p>\r\n<p>Could you respond and ask if there were any Lua errors that occured (or if he/she has Lua errors enabled)?</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully some non-Google translation will help clear things up.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-09-19T04:45:04Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20294%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20294%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>At first he said thanks for all your hard work to make a useful addon. </p>\r\n<p>His question :<br>\r\nBeacuse version of WOW in China is still 4.1, not 4.2, if TellMeWhen version bigger than 4.4.6 will stuck on loading screen, so he hope you can make a \"Standalone\" version (such as 4.4.7) with the rune icon for WOW player in china or tell him how to add the rune icon into version 4.4.6, or make the last version to compatible with WOW 4.1, I told him it's hard to implement for compatible with WOW 4.1, beacuse we don't have 4.1 client to test.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 19 2011 02:47:02 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1316418422\">Sep 19, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lsjyzjl\">lsjyzjl</a>","created_at":"2011-09-19T06:53:59Z"},{"body":" <p>@ilovelbh:<br>\r\n關於你提到的這個問題,因為除了中國大陸之外都已經更新到4.2版本,無法在4.1的環境下測試,所以不可能在新版本中實現對4.1的兼容.<br>\r\n另外,我已經跟作者反應了,讓他考慮看看是不是可以提供一個\"特殊且獨立\"的4.4.6版本,或者是不是可以提供在4.4.6版本添加你所需功能的方法,當然這要看他本人的意願.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lsjyzjl\">lsjyzjl</a>","created_at":"2011-09-19T07:07:01Z"},{"body":" <p>I can't begin to imagine what the problem could be.\r\nThe only thing that crossed my mind was outdated SpellIDs (in equivs, my lovely hardcoding, or from Lib DRData-1.0), but there are checks in place for most things to ensure that invalid spellIDs aren't causing errors in most areas of the code.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 19 2011 23:33:06 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1316493186\">Sep 19, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-09-20T04:11:44Z"},{"body":" <p>YAY IDLE MUSINGS!
