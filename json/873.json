{"issue":{"title":"[CF 873] Invert cooldown sweep option ","body":" <blockquote><cite>Quote:</cite><p>Hi, another question I wanted to ask:</p>\r\n<p>Are we able to reverse the cooldown sweep directly? Specifically speaking, I'm asking about a Combat Event icon I made, which has a reversed timer sweep (it's going from low opacity to full opacity) for some reason.</p>\r\n<p>It looks like all Combat Event icons have their cooldown timer sweep reversed. Is this normal?</p>\r\n</blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tellmewhen?comment=4260\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tellmewhen?comment=4260</a></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/873\">#873</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/873.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-04-26T22:29:08Z","created_at":"2013-10-13T07:17:46Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T22:29:08Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Hype.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Freeebo\">Freeebo</a>","created_at":"2013-10-15T19:29:52Z"},{"body":" <p>Added in g039b557c</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-04-26T22:28:50Z"}]}
