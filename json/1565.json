{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1565] Monk's Stagger total value cannot be tracked through resource bar ","body":" <p>Stagger is not an available resource type in the Resource Display bar options. All other secondary resource types are there, but staggered damage is not, despite it being displayed on the unit frame as a secondary resource. Even \"Alt Power\" doesn't display staggered damage.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Stagger debuffs DO report some stagger number as aura variable #1,&nbsp; and I believe it's your stagger-per-tick, which isn't always helpful because the duration of stagger can change with talents and possibly other ways. However, Stacks * Duration does not return an accurate value of total damage currently staggered.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Edit: Updated for brevity.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/cat_named_classic\">cat_named_classic</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1565\">#1565</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1565.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-09-09T22:01:19Z","created_at":"2018-08-26T11:58:00Z","updated_at":"2018-09-09T22:01:19Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Unless stagger has a max value (far as I know it doesn't) how would you determine the % contribution of the current stagger value?&nbsp; That's probably why it isn't currently available as an option.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ray_smith\">ray_smith</a>","created_at":"2018-09-01T20:11:22Z"},{"body":" <p>The unit frame, which provides it as a bar, uses player HP as a \"maximum.\"</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/cat_named_classic\">cat_named_classic</a>","created_at":"2018-09-07T23:42:18Z"},{"body":" <p>Added in the next version.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-09-09T22:01:19Z"}]}
