{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1193] TMW icon to display the status of an interface setting ","body":" <p>Hello,</p><p>Is there a way to define a TMW icon to display the status of an interface setting?</p><p>For example, there is a setting called Click-to-Move located here:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interface &gt; Mouse &gt; Click-to-Move</p><p>...which, when selected, makes it so that your character will run (or fly) to wherever you click and which I have found to be extremely helpful (due to paralysis in my fingers from quadriplegia) -- but only if I can easily toggle it on and off.</p><p>I found a macro* which does just that (toggles the setting on &amp; off) but now the problem is that I don't always know/remember which position it's in.</p><p>This seems like yet another perfect situation for employing a TMW icon -- configured to show when the setting is on (or off) but I have not been able to figure out how to do it.</p><p>Many thanks</p><p>*/click InterfaceOptionsMousePanelClickToMove 1</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/WeThotUWasAToad\">WeThotUWasAToad</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1193\">#1193</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1193.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-05-19T03:45:05Z","created_at":"2016-02-28T05:36:14Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T03:45:05Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You can add the following as a Lua condition to a Condition icon:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\nGetCVar(\"autointeract\") == \"1\"\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>Here's an export string:</p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLUA ^SName^SGetCVar(\"autointeract\")~`==~`\"1\" ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SCustomTex^S89570 ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SUnAlpha^N0.3 ^SEnabled^B ^t^N70000^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-02-29T03:05:04Z"},{"body":" <p>You could also add the following to a Lua notification handler with the On Click trigger if you want to built the toggling into the status display:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\nInterfaceOptionsMousePanelClickToMove:Click()\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-02-29T03:08:04Z"}]}
