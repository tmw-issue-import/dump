Blizzard's addon protection system (protects modifications to their own addons to prevent hacks/cheats/etc) has been really wonky lately - every time I enter combat, it yells at Dominos for trying to hide and show a bunch of my action bars, even though it isn't doing that at all.</p>\r\n<p>As you can see from the stack trace, this is originating from Blizzard's code. \"TOGGLEWORLDMAP\" is the code that handles the keybinding to show and hide your world map, and FrameXML is the directory where all of Blizzard's interface files are. The same is true for my issue with Dominos (it is originating from Blizzard code). There really isn't anything you can do - these issues seem to be random, and the fixes can be extremely elusive. Only a few other people have reported the issue that I have had with Dominos, and the fixes that they have reported do not work for me. I guess you will just have to live with this - there almost certainly nothing that I can do about it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-12-25T20:14:05Z"}]}
