{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1103] UnitID question ","body":" <p>Basically I'm trying to track a spell cooldown of a certain target. It works if I fill in the specific name of the (enemy) target but the problem is that I want to do it for a certain variable/list. I don't know anything about LUA programming but when I typ /script print(name1) the exact name of the target does show up but my question is if there is a way to call this variable and make it fill in as unitID.</p><p>Hope you understand my question, else I can formulate it differently.
