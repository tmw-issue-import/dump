{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1336] Reactive ability ","body":" <p>Hello,<br>I think since the 7.1 patch the reactive ability doesn't work correctly anymore.

Ice Floes is only unusable when you have 0 stacks, not when you have less than max stacks.</p>\r\n<p>Rune of power isn't a reactive ability in the first place, though, so I'm not sure why you're tracking it as one.
