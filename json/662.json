{"issue":{"title":"[CF 662] Cooldown Text With ElvUI ","body":" <p>I use tellmewhen to track debuffs and buffs on my target. I also use ElvUI which works like OmniCC in that enables duration timers. The problem is While you can edit text display it is being overridden by the ElvUI cooldown timer however turning that off makes it so my action bars no longer have their timers. What I am trying to achieve is simply removing the large centered duration timer on the icons from ElvUI and wondering if that is possible while keeping the cooldown timer on.
