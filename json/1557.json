It now works as in shows the icon if buff is missing. However if I add a \"condition\" to icon to check for number of stacks and if it's less than 3 to show the icon, it gets buggy!</p>\r\n<p>i.e. sometimes it shows the icon even the stack is more than 3! Additionally adding a sound notifications&nbsp; makes it more complicated, the sound sometimes plays and some times doesn't!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ahoora\">Ahoora</a>","created_at":"2018-08-25T04:09:42Z"},{"body":" <p>Post the export string of the icon</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-08-25T05:45:50Z"},{"body":" <p>This is the export:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/5chJZBPA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pastebin.com/5chJZBPA</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I want to show the icon &amp; play a sound when the earth shield on tank in my party has less that 3 stack left</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>this should be done regardless of if tank is group leader or not</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 31 2018 10:12:45 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1535728365\">Aug 31, 2018</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ahoora\">Ahoora</a>","created_at":"2018-08-31T15:12:12Z"},{"body":" <p>You condition is checking unit \"party1\", which could be anyone in your group.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You should use the Stack Requirements settings on the main tab of the icon configuration.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-09-01T19:56:52Z"},{"body":" <p>I am sure I am doing something wrong, but this is the latest based on what you suggested:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/F75F4AVa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pastebin.com/F75F4AVa</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It only shows up when the tank has no earth shield instead of showing/playing sound when stack is less than 3</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ahoora\">Ahoora</a>","created_at":"2018-09-05T05:45:28Z"}]}
