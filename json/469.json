{"issue":{"title":"[CF 469] Allow icons to have default BG / Border color ","body":" <p>It would be really helpful visually if icons could have a default Background Panel&nbsp; or&nbsp; Border color assigned to them. Icons alone can fail to stand out properly against certain busy game scenes, or when layered over other UI elements.</p><p>This would also make the event animations which change BG / Border color more useful, since a preexisting default border (for example, black) could become highlighted bright yellow, etc.</p><p>Also, on the topic of the new Border animation, it's very difficult to set this in a consistent/satisfactory way with the Slider method of input. An entry box which allowed the user to enter a specific number (for example, 10 pixels larger than the icon size) would be very helpful.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Lov3star\">Lov3star</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/469\">#469</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/469.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-04-21T03:12:14Z","created_at":"2012-03-16T02:50:36Z","updated_at":"2013-04-21T03:12:14Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It has precision to 0.1 pixels.

One, I find AddOns are generally more reliable when self-contained. Two, it reduces flexibility to change colors or details on a per-icon basis.

Currently we can change the opacity which is great, but I actually find that I check my timers using OmniCC and can't always see them with the opacity lowered. At the same time I want to differentiate between icons that are immediately important and those that are not. Opacity is currently the only option I have. I am aware that I can use events, to go some way to address this, but these I presonally used for procs and showing when long cooldowns are available. I absolutely love this addon though. So powerful.
