{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1403] Connecting different groups ","body":" <p>I'd like to request a feature for an ability to connect undefined number of groups to share eg. visibility conditions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example, making a comprehensive UI combining multiple bar and icon groups at the moment means you are forced to copy the visibility conditionals over from one group to all \"sub groups\" if you want them to behave in a similar manner, and using certain conditions (like mouseover on a group) only applies to one group at a time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This makes it cumbersome or in some cases totally impossible to start up this type of \"meta group\", but it also means if you ever want to change things up you need to repeat the process on all groups that share those conditions.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Qustav_R\">Qustav_R</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1403\">#1403</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1403.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-08-06T05:30:38Z","created_at":"2017-04-26T13:18:27Z","updated_at":"2017-08-06T05:30:38Z","labels":["declined","enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Probably not going to happen.
