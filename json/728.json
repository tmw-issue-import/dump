{"issue":{"title":"[CF 728] Help with mangle/shred button ","body":" <p>For feral druid:&nbsp; I'm afraid this one has stumped me so looking for a little help. Mangle is my \"1\" hotkey button and I swap it with Shred in groups. I tried to break the habit but it works best for me. Occasionally I forget to put shred in my \"1\" key slot in groups/raids which is a huge dps loss.</p><p>What I want is a TMW icon to tell me when I have used Mangle but only if&nbsp; I am grouped or in a raid (don't want the warning when solo). Mangle is still used in raids based on position so I don't need anything overly loud, but just a slight couple second warning when the Mangle action is used to warn me to check that I meant to use it and not Shred.</p><p>Thanks so much.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
