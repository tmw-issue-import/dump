{"issue":{"title":"[CF 805] Conditions compilation fails when spell names contain quotes ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Creating a condition for spell that has quotes in the name (I've only seen those in localized version for RU, but may happen anywhere)</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>Generated function code for condition declares a local variable in the very beginning with the value \"&lt;spell_name&gt;\".<br>When spell name contains quotes (in Russian localization literally 'Command \"Kill!\"') it turns into local &lt;some_variable&gt; = \"Command \"Kill!\"\" and obviously compilation of that function fails. It then starts failing anywhere where it's trying to apply the condition, presumably because function compilation returned nil and it's being used from there.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
