{"issue":{"title":"[CF 112] Problem Tracking Nature's Grace CD ","body":" <p>Using version 4.0.3a</p><p>I'm simply trying to track the cooldown for the Nature's Grace talent for Druids so I know when to cast another spell to activate it again.</p><p>Talent information can be found here:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61346\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61346</a></p><p>The spell has a 60 second cooldown before it can be activated again, but I can't seem to track the cooldown for it. I've tried by name, and by spell ID. I can get it to show as a buff when the ability activates, but when I switch it to cooldown to track when it will come available again, it never activates.</p><p>Am I missing something? I've checked all of the common things posted in your pages.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/DoubleDizle\">DoubleDizle</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/112\">#112</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/112.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-02-05T18:53:25Z","created_at":"2011-02-05T03:56:14Z","updated_at":"2011-02-05T18:53:25Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Sorry.. version 3.04a</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/DoubleDizle\">DoubleDizle</a>","created_at":"2011-02-05T03:58:32Z"},{"body":" <p>You can close this ticket, I figured out the issue.
