{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1455] Protection Warrior -Missing Buff (Shild block) ","body":" <p>Hi, i'm trying (since WoD) to create an icon for \"Shild Block\", telling me the duration of my active block.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I managed to create a seperate icon showing my stacks as well as my cooldown timer to ACTIVATE \"Shild Block\", but when it comes to create an icon that shows me the durability of the BUFF from \"Shild Block\" - im failing every time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I think, i may have figured out why. Simply because all the buffs i can select are wrong - at least for the german tooltips.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on how accurate TMW is checking buffs, it seems, that the icon simply didn't work, because it's waiting for buffs, that dont exist any more (at 7.3).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is that&nbsp; possible?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And if that is the reason why, could u please implement the right buff for \"Shild Block\"?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Im not sure how the english client shows the tooltip, but it should be something like : \"Blockchance increased by 100%\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much :-)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ceeron89\">Ceeron89</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1455\">#1455</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1455.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-02-01T04:13:21Z","created_at":"2018-01-14T02:05:19Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T04:13:21Z","labels":["invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>If the icon isn't working, you typed something in wrong or configured it wrong.
