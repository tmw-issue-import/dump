Because I do. There are just way too many special cases that apply to meta icons that don't apply to any other icon type.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if I declare that meta icons use the duration attributes, then they will implement the four duration-related events, but they will also have to implement the duration min/max setting.</p>\r\n<p>Now, if I expand that and say that I also want meta icons to be able to implement the On Spell Changed event, then they will also have to implement the configuration for power bar overlays, even though these overlays won't actually work because the inherited data from other icons will always override it.</p>\r\n<p>Rant, rant, rant. Basically, the framework that I just spent the last 3 months designing and building doesn't work well at all with meta icons.</p>\r\n<p>EDIT: nevermind. I managed to completely forget about the part that I made that allows for half-decent handling of situations like this.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 12 2012 18:54:07 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1344815647\">Aug 12, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-12T23:43:58Z"},{"body":" <p>I've built this condition icon:</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SChecked^B ^SUnit^Splayer;`party1-4 ^SName^SBlessing`of`Kings ^t^N2^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SChecked^B ^SUnit^Splayer;`party1-4 ^SName^SBlessing`of`Might ^t^N3^T ^SType^SINSTANCE ^SOperator^S|= ^SLevel^N1 ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^t^N4^T ^SType^SINSTANCE ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^SOperator^S|= ^SLevel^N2 ^t^Sn^N4 ^t^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sbar^T ^STextLayout^Sbar1 ^t^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^Sicon1 ^t^t^SCustomTex^SBlessing`of`Kings ^SEnabled^B ^t^N60015^S`| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>It's basically supposed to tell me when I haven't buffed Kings or Might. And it's still very basic. I first set out to build an icon with the same functionality using a Buff/Debuff icon, but I ran into trouble. Not able to pinpoint the issue I created a condition icon instead and it's still not working. However it's beginning to dawn on me that the icon isn't updating properly on aura gains/fades. The icon assumes the correct state after opening and closing TMW, but remains unchanged after buffing or clicking off Kings.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 15 2012 01:50:14 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1345013414\">Aug 15, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-08-14T16:12:44Z"},{"body":" <p>When copying the position/scale of another group TMW doesn't copy the relative point setting, leading to the copied group ending up somewhere else than the original group.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 15 2012 01:50:30 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1345013430\">Aug 15, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-08-15T06:37:35Z"},{"body":" <p>I think I have gotten workarounds implemented for most of the script ran too long errors.</p>\r\n<p>The only caveat is that TMW is now forcibly locked while in combat now (since errors pop up if you try to lock it while in combat, TMW locks itself immediately before WoW goes into combat lockdown and the script run duration limit is enforced.)</p>\r\n<p>All config frames (the icon editor and the main options frame from '/tmw options' and the LDB plugin) are also closed when entering combat and cannot be opened while in combat.</p>\r\n<p>Now I wait for beta servers to come back up.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-15T06:49:15Z"},{"body":" <p>Tickets like this are hard to keep track of.
