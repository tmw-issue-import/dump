{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1120] Showing GCD instead of Charge timer ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>7.3.1</p><p>Hey Cy,</p><p>I'm having trouble with some icons on my enchancement shaman, namely Stormstrike , Fire Nova and Lava Lash.<br>All 3 icons have 2 charges (with the Echo of the Elements talent) and the issue is identical on all of them.</p><p>I want to simply show the GCD timer, like I do for most of my icons, however the timer animation is showing the time until a new charge occurs, rather than the GCD. I've tried using other icons and showing different durations, etc. on my display icon but have not been able to figure this one out.</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1120\">#1120</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1120.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-05-25T19:57:34Z","created_at":"2015-05-20T12:29:42Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T19:57:34Z","labels":["defect","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This behavior is working as intended, and there are no plans to change it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-05-25T19:57:25Z"}]}
