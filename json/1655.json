{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1655] DOESN’T TRACK IMPRISON’S CD MODIFIED BY DETAINMENT CORRECTLY ","body":" <p>Hey,<br>I&rsquo;m not really sure how to setup the addon, but TellMeWhen doesn&rsquo;t track Imprison&rsquo;s CD correctly when I use the PvP talent Detainment. The talent increases the Imprison&rsquo;s duration from 45s to 1min., but TellMeWhen always shows that the spell is ready after 45s.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any solution for this?
