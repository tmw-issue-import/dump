{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1356] Cooldown/Debuff/Buff comparison with Variable GCD &amp; Fractional Spell Charges ","body":" <p>Hello,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a Retribution Paladin my Global Cooldown (from here on called GCD) is very variable. For my char it varies from 1.2 to 0.4 seconds depending on buffs infight.</p>\r\n<p>I have many TMW checks in place where i want to compare Buff Durations or remaining cooldowns on spells with my GCD. As there is no such feature implemented in TMW where you can compare a Buff or Debuff with a variable value like that I have no other choice than comparing with fixed values (in my case 1.2 sec.).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In order to enable much more precise TMW configurations I suggest a function for variable Buff/Debuff/Spell Cooldown comparison where you could do something like:</p>\r\n<p>If \"Cooldown/Buff/Debuff X\" &lt; 2* current GCD</p>\r\n<p>So it should be also possible to use arithmetical expressions with those Variables.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My second suggestion would be to expand the possibilities of the already implemented Spell Charge feature in order to check for fractional spellcharges, e.g.:</p>\r\n<p>Spellcharges Crusader Strike &lt;= 1.33</p>\r\n<p>It is possible to create a workaround with the existing tmw functionality, but this implementation would make it much easier.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Zoddo13\">Zoddo13</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1356\">#1356</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1356.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-25T00:47:47Z","created_at":"2017-01-02T15:12:06Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T00:47:47Z","labels":["enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>&nbsp;Its a neat idea, but unlikely to happen at this point.
