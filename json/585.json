{"issue":{"title":"[CF 585] Death Knight Runes ","body":" <p>Playing around with runes on my dk I've found several possibilities for enhancement.</p><p>a) There doesn't seem to be a way to tell if a rune is going to be a death rune before it's actually ready.</p><p>b) The cooldown of a rune can't be compared to a number. With spell cooldowns you can check if they're &gt;&lt; x seconds. With runes you can't.</p><p>c) With patch 5.0.4. there have come quite a few new abilities with extra charges. I don't know if it's OmniCC or Blizzard but you may be familiar with how the first charge of those abilities has the normal grey cooldown sweep, then the second one has a golden one and a small number indicates the number of available charges. I think it'd be pretty neat if the same could be done with runes if multiple runes are checked.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/585\">#585</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/585.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-04-21T02:31:50Z","created_at":"2012-09-04T02:30:22Z","updated_at":"2013-04-21T02:31:50Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Better late than never?
