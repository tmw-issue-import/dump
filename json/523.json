I can promise you I would get an enormous amount of benefit from this change.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes I have a really intricate icon (like my super-hacky system for detecting which pet I Grimoire of Sacrificed, and displaying the appropriate inherited ability's cooldown) that works amazing, it could not be created outside TellMeWhen without making my own custom addon.</p>\r\n<p>Except if I accidentally /tmw, or zone, it gets all messed up because TellMeWhen stops things like \"On Show\" animations and resets Condition / Combat Event timers, etc.</p>\r\n<p>It's really no major thing, in the heat of combat it's usually never an issue, but it would make everything a lot more tidy and stable when I have really elaborate icon designs going on. ^.~</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Lov3star\">Lov3star</a>","created_at":"2012-09-29T05:39:21Z"},{"body":" <p>Added an On Icon Setup event in r648 that should be able to achieve this functionality.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-11-05T06:46:32Z"}]}
