{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1061] Implment some way to track feral DoT strength ","body":" <p>It will probably be in the form a condition (or several). I will have to do some research to see what the best way to determine this would be - A simple \"Should I Apply This Feral DoT Now Because It Will Be Better Than The Current One\" check, or something like \"Is The Current DoT Snapshotted With Bloodtalons\", etc. I suspect the first will be the best way to do it.</p><p>As part of this feature, I propose to myself a simple function that I can add in to warn about the need to verify various things each time a new WoW patch comes along. Something like this may change in the future, so that would be useful. It could also be added to things like the class spell cache, and even equivalencies.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1061\">#1061</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1061.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-09-09T22:08:04Z","created_at":"2015-01-05T06:03:01Z","updated_at":"2018-09-09T22:08:04Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Upvoted.
