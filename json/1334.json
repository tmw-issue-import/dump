{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1334] Unit Range goes from Precise to imprecise sometimes ","body":" <p>Hi there.<br>I have a problem with the \"Unit Range\" meter.It goes sometimes from \"Precise\" to \"Imprecise\" without a solid reason or at least i couldnt find it. I noticed it after i first startet wow and logged in or after i go into my demon class hall.I tried but i couldnt find a way to reproduce the problem and say thats the reason why it happens.</p><p>If it is imprecise it stays imprecise and if i move the bar while it is imprecise it stays always red. Its going to funktion normally until i reload.<br>I dont know if it is an addon conflict or just a display bug and it wont effect the range calculation.</p><p>I did a screenshot of it when it is imprecise(red)and correct(green)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1334\">#1334</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1334.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-11-02T01:09:26Z","created_at":"2016-11-01T20:08:46Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T01:09:26Z","labels":["defect","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/86/139/Green.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> Green.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/86/139/Green.jpg\" title=\"Green.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/86/139/126/126/Green.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">Green.jpg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-11-01T20:08:46Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/86/142/Red.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> Red.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/86/142/Red.jpg\" title=\"Red.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/86/142/126/126/Red.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">Red.jpg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-11-01T20:08:46Z"},{"body":" <p>I can't reproduce this, but it is almost certainly a display bug only.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-11-02T01:09:16Z"}]}
