{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1016] OmniCC override text too small ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Subsequently, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Backup\". Select the \"To string\" option for the appropriate export type (icon, group, or profile), and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS WILL RESULT IN YOUR TICKET BEING INVALIDATED.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. enable text timer<br>2. Have OmniCC installed<br>3. When spell procs with timer text, timer is too small.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>Larger text size to repect OmniCC's font size</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>7.1.2-18-gf2099f3</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>No</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p><p>Screenshot attached of the problem.</p><p>With OmniCC installed, it overrides any TMW font edits (that is fine, it should), however, the text is extremely small in TMW and hard to read.</p><p>Not sure if you can fix this but I remember it not being an issue in past builds so perhaps something changed in OmniCC (using 6.0.4) that changes the way font sizes are passed and handled in TMW? Disabling automatic scaling in OmniCC does nothing to change this issue.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/transitbus\">transitbus</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1016\">#1016</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1016.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-10-31T14:48:02Z","created_at":"2014-10-31T06:59:13Z","updated_at":"2014-10-31T20:47:13Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/148/WoWScrnShot_103114_015531.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> WoWScrnShot_103114_015531.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/148/WoWScrnShot_103114_015531.jpg\" title=\"WoWScrnShot_103114_015531.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/148/126/126/WoWScrnShot_103114_015531.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">WoWScrnShot_103114_015531.jpg</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;Font scaling issue with OmniCC&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/transitbus\">transitbus</a>","created_at":"2014-10-31T06:59:13Z"},{"body":" <p>TMW does not interact in any way with OmniCC's texts.
