{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1125] 2 Timer Combat Event/Unit Cooldown ","body":" <p>Is it possible to create an 'exception' to events or cooldowns that, if detected before it is set to supposedly be available, to have the cooldown altered to a shorter time?</p><p>For example, a DK's dark sim is a 60 second cooldown, but can be glyphed to 30. If the combat log detects a DK uses a sim more than once every 60 seconds, the unit cooldown will change from a 60 second tracking to a 30 second tracking.</p><p>More than a few abilities have their cooldowns altered in this way, so a standard tracking isn't always accurate.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1125\">#1125</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1125.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-06-01T05:29:12Z","created_at":"2015-05-31T13:12:14Z","updated_at":"2015-06-01T05:29:12Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It would be cool, but it isn't something that is likely to happen at this point. There are so many rules that would have be coded for and updated every expansion. Plus, there are issues with timing and latency that could lead to false positives or false negatives. Also, when does the system's knowledge of suspected glyphs/talents reset? This is less problematic in arena and BGs, but in raids, instances, and open world, talent and glyph changes can happen at any time.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-05-31T18:26:10Z"}]}
