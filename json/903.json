{"issue":{"title":"[CF 903] Activation border when spell not active? ","body":" <p>Hello,</p><p>I play a hunter and would like for my serpent sting TMW icon to have Blizzard's activation border around it when it's NOT active on my current hostile target. I can get it to where it will do what I want it only after the debuff falls off. I want it to where when I even look at a new target, the icon will glow. Sorry if this is a simple fix, but I've been trying just about everything! Thanks in advace!</p><p>Screenshot included.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mdbryner\">mdbryner</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/903\">#903</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/903.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-01-23T18:15:53Z","created_at":"2014-01-02T14:14:05Z","updated_at":"2014-01-23T18:16:25Z","labels":["declined"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/49/WoWScrnShot_010214_090751.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> WoWScrnShot_010214_090751.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/49/WoWScrnShot_010214_090751.jpg\" title=\"WoWScrnShot_010214_090751.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/49/126/126/WoWScrnShot_010214_090751.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">WoWScrnShot_010214_090751.jpg</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;Screenshot&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mdbryner\">mdbryner</a>","created_at":"2014-01-02T14:14:05Z"},{"body":" <p>If that is a Buff/Debuff icon, then add a Stop Animations animation to the icon's On Start event and add an Activation Border event to the icon's On Finish event.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-01-04T06:37:23Z"},{"body":" <p>No response after two weeks.
