{"issue":{"title":"[CF 965] Icon is darker if \"all absent\" is checked ","body":" <p>I've noticed that all my (buff) icons are darker when they are at \"Any present\" state if I have \"All absent\" opacity option checked, regardless of that opacity, when I have timer sweep turned off. It's actually the same darkness of the cooldown sweep as if the sweep had gone full 360 degrees (or 0 degrees if inverted). I'll add a screenshot to this post too. I have OmniCC but it doesn't matter if it's enabled or not. </p>\r\n<p><em><strong>What steps will reproduce the problem?</strong></em><br>\r\n1. Add a buff icon<br>\r\n2. Check to show \"All absent\" and some opacity for that<br>\r\n3. Don't use cooldown sweep animation</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</strong></em><br>\r\nI expect to have the icon appear at a normal color / \"luminocity\" when the buff is present regardless of whether it's shown or not when the buff is absent.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?

In my opinion changing the \"absent\" state just shouldn't by default affect at all how the \"present\" state looks, it's illogical.
