{"issue":{"title":"[CF 489] Multiple entries not ignoring invalid entries ","body":" <p>It has irked me for a while now that if I build a cooldown icon with multiple entries, the icon will not skip invalid entries.</p><p>For example, because I use the same TellMeWhen profile on multiple characters with different levels of equipment I'd like to have an icon that tracks the Vicious, Ruthless and Cataclysmic Gladiator's Medallion of Tenacity. However the only way I can do that right now is by building 3 different icons and then uniting them with a metaicon. If I just input them into the same icon like so: \"Vicious Gladiator's Medallion of Tenacity; Ruthless Gladiator's Medallion of Tenacity; Cataclysmic Gladiator's Medallion of Tenacity\" the icon will just bug out unless I have the first one in the sequence equipped.</p><p>A second example would be when I change my spec. I might want the same icon to track the cooldown of Tree of Life in one spec and Survival Instincts in another.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/489\">#489</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/489.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-09T21:25:06Z","created_at":"2012-04-28T15:11:05Z","updated_at":"2012-05-09T21:25:06Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>For the item cooldown problem, do you have the \"Only if in bags\" or \"Only if equipped\" settings enabled?</p>\r\n<p>For the spell cooldown problem, nothing is going to change there.
