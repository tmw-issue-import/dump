{"issue":{"title":"[CF 545] 6.0.1 - Icon Condition Colors Messed Up ","body":" <p>I had my color conditions set up correctly, e.g. Missing Flame Shock debuff is greyscale, Present Flame Shock is full color. Version 6.0.1 broke this functionality. 1 of the color conditions will work and the other wont, usually just grey all the time. I'm using Finished, Always Shown with a white color and grey boxed checked for missing debuffs and I'm using Counting, Timer Shown, Always Shown with a white box and grey box not check for full color when the debuff is ticking. This broke upon update. It affects my totem tracking icon too.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lotsoftoons\">lotsoftoons</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/545\">#545</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/545.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-08-29T01:13:43Z","created_at":"2012-08-29T01:00:19Z","updated_at":"2012-08-29T01:13:43Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Please do not ignore the ticket template that is provided.
