{"issue":{"title":"[CF 944] Hardcode in some spells that aren't actually spellstealable ","body":" <p>From <a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/forum/mage/48109-show-any-spellstealable-buffs-on-your-target/#p4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/forum/mage/48109-show-any-spellstealable-buffs-on-your-target/#p4</a></p><p>Since Blizzard is unlikely to ever fix it, I will hardcode in a few exceptions for things that are marked as spellstealable, but actually aren't. So far all I have is Iceblock. I don't play a mage, so I don't notice other spells that might also be incorrectly flagged, although I suspect pally bubble is also guilty of this.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/944\">#944</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/944.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-04-26T22:11:45Z","created_at":"2014-04-21T16:26:11Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T22:11:45Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Done in g70f6be5 </p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-04-26T22:11:38Z"}]}
