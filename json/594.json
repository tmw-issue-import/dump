Just started useing the addon and love it.</p><p>Sorry to bug you, I'm sure this is just user error. I am trying to get my Vampiric Touch icon to pop up whenever my target does not have the debuff and then pop up again 2 seconds before it falls off so I can start the cast before it actually falls off.</p><p>I have tried a few different ways of configuring the icon including this one useing a debuff condition, but all I can get it to do is pop up after the debuff has completely fallen off.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/FerrisThe2nd\">FerrisThe2nd</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/594\">#594</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/594.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-07T10:56:09Z","created_at":"2012-09-06T23:19:22Z","updated_at":"2012-09-07T10:56:13Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Sorry.</p>\r\n<p>Version 6.0.2</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/FerrisThe2nd\">FerrisThe2nd</a>","created_at":"2012-09-06T23:21:35Z"},{"body":" <p>Its not showing when it has between 0 and 2 second remaining because you have it set to hide when the debuff is present.</p>\r\n<p>Revised export string: </p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^Starget ^SType^Sbuff ^SUnAlpha^N0.6 ^SAlpha^N0.6 ^SName^S34914 ^SDurationMaxEnabled^B ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SOnlyMine^B ^SEnabled^B ^SDurationMax^N2 ^t^N60317^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 6 2012 18:33:05 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1346974385\">Sep 6, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-09-06T23:32:55Z"},{"body":" <p>That's fantastic. </p>\r\n<p>I misunderstood what the Duration Requirements were.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you so much!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/FerrisThe2nd\">FerrisThe2nd</a>","created_at":"2012-09-07T01:23:21Z"}]}
