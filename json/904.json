There is a message that you will see when you attempt to track more than 100 units of a specific type as a safety check since the most of any unit you could want is currently 40. Did you accidentally enter \"maintank 1-400\"?</p>\r\n<p>maintank is only a valid unit in TMW when you are in a raid and some of your raid members are marked as a maintank in the raid interface (their specialization/role has nothing to do with this). If you want to track a specific unit, and this unit is consistent (i.e. someone from your guild, or a friend, who you frequently run with), track them by name. Otherwise, you should set the tank as your focus target and set your TMW icon to watch your focus.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 23 2014 12:15:21 (CDT) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1390500921\">Jan 23, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-01-04T06:45:02Z"},{"body":" <p>No response after two weeks.
