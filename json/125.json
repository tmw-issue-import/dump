{"issue":{"title":"[CF 125] Ability to detect states, like macros does ","body":" <p>It would be very nice if the condition could include much of the things that macros can detect ([swimming][mounted][group:party], etc).</p><p>Example.... reminding me about my DKs Presence: I want the condition to be \"remind of of blood presence if I'm in a group, not mounted, don't have the buff and is in spec 2\".</p><p>Right now I have it on spec 2, and buff not available. That however mean that if I'm in spec 2 and flying around Stormwind in unholy presence (for faster movement) I'm still getting the reminder.</p><p>I can't seem to find a way to detect if I'm mounted, swimming, in a group, and other such things. Any way they could be added to the condition?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Exaid\">Exaid</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/125\">#125</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/125.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-02-27T00:53:55Z","created_at":"2011-02-22T21:28:18Z","updated_at":"2011-02-27T08:49:40Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I will add a condition for swimming and mounted.
