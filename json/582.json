{"issue":{"title":"[CF 582] editing mode in combat ","body":" <p>So i noticed that editing mode turns off when combat starts. It didnt turn off in previous versions of TMW and I loved it<br>I couldnt find anything in options to allow editing in combat, was that change really needed? It seems like step backwards.<br>I'm used to enabling/disabling bars between bosses while raiding .<br>Sometimes I forget about it so I quickly edit them when boss fight starts, now however I cant do anything for 10 mins till combat is over. Is there any other way to enable/disable single bars in combat?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Onorc\">Onorc</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/582\">#582</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/582.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-06T03:27:50Z","created_at":"2012-09-03T15:51:18Z","updated_at":"2012-09-06T03:27:50Z","labels":["declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I didn't want to do this, but Blizzard decided it would be cute to place limits on the amount of CPU that addons can use while in combat. The actual process of toggling between locked and unlocked states can be quite cpu-intensive, and if the throttle limit is reached during this process, the whole thing just terminates, and you are left with a half locked, half unlocked TMW that probably isn't going to be very useful at all (and will probably spam you with all kinds of other errors, too, possibly preventing you from locking/unlocking even out of combat until you reload your UI).</p>\r\n<p>I have been trying to think of a good way to safely allow toggling between locked and unlocked states in combat if your profile is small enough, but its not easy to come up with measurements with low enough variance to be reliable for such a purpose.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-09-03T23:30:05Z"},{"body":" <p>To answer your second question, I still allow the slash commands for toggling to be used in combat.
