{"issue":{"title":"[CF 175] Condition: Target:Class ","body":" <p>Hi Gang,</p><p>First of all I love this addon. I would love to have a way to setup a series of groups with spells that are only displayed with the corresponding Target:Class.<br>For example I make a group of icons that is centered around rogue class, and then one group for each of the other classes. Then depending on my target, only the matching group is displayed (\"activated\").</p><p>1) This conditional check would ignore the logic of the icon within the group. So if I target a class, then my icons within the bar trigger and do their thing, but then I switch targets to a new enemy:same class, then the group icon dont change up to the new class ( That would be ideal), but rather for a first draft it could just be left to me as the player to pay attention<br>2) in a state where I have a group active from a class, then I change targets to a different class, the first group becomes hidden, and the icons within the group just finished out what ever it is they are supposed to do.<br>2a) Im guessing that the visibility of the group instance would take precendence over the icons within the group.</p><p>Thanks for the consideration</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/dolthaic\">dolthaic</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/175\">#175</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/175.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-04-27T23:46:07Z","created_at":"2011-04-21T16:16:50Z","updated_at":"2011-04-27T23:46:07Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
