{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1520] Condition/Notification can only accept one unit - How to use with raid wide buffs ","body":" <p>Hey there,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm currently using TMW to track the number of atonements on the raid. This is working as I'd expect, however using [stacks] as the text output was always showing 0, so I'm using [RaidStacks(\"Atonement\")] and this works perfectly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What I want to do, is when reaching more than 10 stacks of atonement on the raid is to have a notification on the icon, lets say activation border. The issue is that I can't add a condition to check this because conditions can only accept one unit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I also tried making a second icon and using a meta icon and using stack requirements on the second icon, this does not work. I can only assume because it always thinks stacks = 0 and I can't see a way to make stack requirements use RaidStacks instead.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas how I can make this work?</p>\r\n<p>-Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Edit: The import string for the icon:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SUnit^Splayer;~`party;~`raid ^SSort^N-1 ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SAtonement ^SEnabled^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^S,ZS0IeuiUr]E ^STexts^T ^N1^S[Duration(gcd=true):TMWFormatDuration] ^N2^S[RaidStacks(\"Atonement\")] ^t^t^t^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N2^T ^SAlpha^N0.4 ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N82302^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>^1 ^T^N1^T ^SDefaultText^S[Duration(gcd=true):TMWFormatDuration] ^SAnchors^T ^N1^T ^Sy^N-3 ^Spoint^STOP ^SrelativePoint^STOP ^t^t^SStringName^STimer ^t^N2^T ^SDefaultText^S[Stacks:Hide(0)] ^SAnchors^T ^N1^T ^Sy^N2 ^Spoint^SBOTTOM ^SrelativePoint^SBOTTOM ^t^t^SStringName^SStacks ^t^SGUID^S,ZS0IeuiUr]E ^Sn^N2 ^SName^SStacks~`&amp;~`Timer ^t^N82302^S~`~| ^Stextlayout^S,ZS0IeuiUr]E ^^</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/KesaraED\">KesaraED</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1520\">#1520</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1520.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-07-21T18:08:17Z","created_at":"2018-07-21T12:37:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T00:11:07Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>There are currently no ways to do what you're asking.
