{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1236] Group growth and priority ","body":" <p>So recently I have created a group that has quite a few abilities listed in it, including ones that are from the talents, when the talents aren't selected the icon does not show which is great, however if i change then it is loaded further down in the group and will leave a gap.</p><p>This can be remedied by using the priorities to move the icons along when the ones before it aren't showing, however I like to have my icons centred in my screen.</p><p>Therefore I would like to ask if there is a method of setting the anchor to the middle of the group and have the icons extend out from there based on the priority, or if it would be possible to add this feature.</p><p>I have been meddling with the Anchor points but they do not appear to change anything so maybe I'm doing it wrong?</p><p>Apologies if there is a post on this already, I did a search on the forums and nothing was returned.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/GrimmClassic\">GrimmClassic</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1236\">#1236</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1236.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-23T06:32:46Z","created_at":"2016-07-21T18:57:10Z","updated_at":"2016-07-23T06:32:46Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>No, there isn't a way of doing this right now.</p>\r\n<p>The reason that the anchor settings don't seem to work is that the group's size doesn't change based on the icons that are showing - it is always sized to fit the maximum number of icons in the group. I suppose it would be possible to add a setting to cause the group to resize to fit the shown icons as closely as possible, which would allow you to do what you're doing. I'll have to think about it a bit, though, because it might cause some unforseen issues.</p>\r\n<p>This has been requested in the past though, so it isn't an obscure thing that only one person would use, so that does increase the chance that it will get implemented <span>:)</span></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 21 2016 18:06:03 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1469142363\">Jul 21, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-21T19:47:23Z"}]}
