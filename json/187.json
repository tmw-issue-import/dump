{"issue":{"title":"[CF 187] Unit cooldown conditions not checked ","body":" <p>For some reason the \"unit cooldown\" function doesn't seem to be checking any of its conditions. Perhaps this is related to the fact that it is the only function where the \"conditions/duration/stacks\" slider is absent. (is this set to 100% somewhere?)</p><p>Also it would be a huge relief for my efforts if enemy cooldowns could also be checked as a condition themselves. That way I could build an icon to display if none of my enemys had an interrupt available.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/187\">#187</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/187.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-05-02T21:31:50Z","created_at":"2011-05-01T19:28:23Z","updated_at":"2011-05-02T21:31:50Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Try r65 and let me know if it is working.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-05-02T00:24:40Z"},{"body":" <p>Upon initial review it seems to be working fine now.
