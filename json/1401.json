I sent you a message about this, say I wanted to track every spell named 'Branded' except for a specific one, which I could then omit via -SpellID. Pretty sure omitting only works for precompiled spell lists like CC/defensives/cooldowns.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1401\">#1401</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1401.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-04-01T23:47:17Z","created_at":"2017-04-17T20:51:47Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T23:47:17Z","labels":["declined","enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Omitting spells like that is never going to happen. I would have to make significant changes to every icon type. The best you can do is just include the IDs of every one that you DO care about - there must be a finite number of them, after all.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I may get around to adding those conditions at some point, but no promises.</p>\r\n<p>&gt; For loot spec, GetLootSpecialization() is the function. Run \"/dump GetLootSpecialization()\" to get the current value for your spec, and add a Lua condition like \"GetLootSpecialization() == 253\" to check it against a particular spec. 0 is the value for \"current spec\".</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Loot open isn't as straightforward, but I also don't think that I would ever add that to TMW anyway - its too much of a condition of the interface rather than a condition of gameplay.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"04 30 2017 00:32:20 (CDT) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1493530340\">Apr 30, 2017</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-04-30T05:31:55Z"}]}
