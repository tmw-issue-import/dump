This lets the group that you're configuring be displayed on top in case you have overlapping icons. It used to be the case that this brought-to-top state would be reset, but it appears to be no longer true, so I'll have to remove that behavior so the setting works correctly now.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-12-24T22:04:02Z"}]}
