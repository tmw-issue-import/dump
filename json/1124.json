{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1124] Steady Focus tracking ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)\r\n7.3.2 r1</p>\r\n<p>Hey Cy,</p>\r\n<p>Wondering if you can help me make an icon for my hunter. <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=177667\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steady Focus</a> talent gives a focus regen boost if you cast <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77767\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra Shot</a> twice in a row. However there is no buff for the first <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77767\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra Shot</a> to track.</p>\r\n<p>I'm sure I need a timer, but I'm afraid I am still a little naive on those. I want to be able to show an icon when have cast one Cobra Shot and show an icon warning me to cast another one (since casting another spell, resets the criteria of 2 in a row) </p>\r\n<p>(Laymans: Show icon when <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77767\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra Shot</a> has been cast. Then hide it when <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=177667\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steady Focus</a> is activated from a second <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77767\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra Shot</a>, or hide it if I should cast something else - resetting the 2-count.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks man, appreciate all your work as always!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1124\">#1124</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1124.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-06-16T18:51:54Z","created_at":"2015-05-30T23:10:27Z","updated_at":"2015-06-16T18:52:03Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You need a counter, not a timer.</p>\r\n<p>Make a combat event icon that triggers when you cast cobra shot.
