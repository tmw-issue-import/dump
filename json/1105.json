{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1105] Icon desaturation - Lava burst ","body":" <p>Hello guys! First of all I'd like to thank you for the effort you put into this freaking awesome addon, it's simple the best. So here's my problem / issue. Since patch 6.1 Echo of the Elements (that gives 2 charges of lava burst) is kinda mandatory for elemental shammies. What i want to do is make the icon of a spell i use turn grey (desaturated) when that certain spell is on cooldown or when that spell meets a certain condition. If I use the option you have in Colors tab of Tellmewhen it works ok for every other spell but not lava burst. When I have 2 charges of lava burst the icon has the normal color, but when i use one charge the icon immediately turns grey even if i have one more charge availabe and it turns back to it's normal redish color only when i have 2 charges again. Is there any way I could make it so it turns grey only when I'm not able to cast it? (when i have 0 lava burst charges)? Is there any other way around this? I tried with Notifications &gt;&gt; while condition set passing &gt;&gt; animation &gt;&gt; color flash and used grey color there with opacity but you don't really get the desaturated icon. Or maybe any lua code for getting the icon desaturated?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/bobbytza18\">bobbytza18</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1105\">#1105</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1105.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-03-27T17:30:50Z","created_at":"2015-03-27T16:32:03Z","updated_at":"2015-03-29T07:13:33Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Fixed in g0442dc3 - cooldown icons with charges remaining won't be treated as if they're \"counting\" for the color settings.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-03-27T17:20:49Z"},{"body":" <p>So what should i do now?
