{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1528] Anyway accurately track adaptation arena ","body":" <p>I've tried using unit cooldown to track adapt but anytime a rogue/feral or any class that can go invis , goes stealth or worst case an arcane mage cast mass invisibility on the whole team, the unit will come back out with the adapted debuff and restart the one minute timer. Any way to track it once its triggered? or in general so stealth is'nt an issue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/bambziqt\">bambziqt</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1528\">#1528</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1528.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-25T01:02:44Z","created_at":"2018-07-23T03:56:31Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T01:02:44Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Can't you just track the debuff directly?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-07-24T02:54:37Z"},{"body":" <p>Yes and no, the timer can&rsquo;t be refreshed and is seen on the unit but if the unit goes into stealth the timer disappear .

I think it's something I asked about before, but I don't remember what he said. The only other way to do it would be having something like a meta icon of 3 or 4 different Adapted buffs, each in a daisy chain of sorts of situations. Bottom of the meta icon would be the Adapted cooldown and then above it would be some kind of whacky shit like \"Adapted is showing but he used [racial] so start combat event of Adapted = 30s CD\" and then copy that 3 times for WOTF/EMFH/stoneform. It'll get annoying, especially so to make sure it's set up right.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although honestly, just download Gladius. If you're doing PVP you should have it anyway.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2018-08-15T12:27:30Z"}]}
