{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1156] Show Dot strength icon ","body":" <p>First of all,hi and thx for this addon.</p><p>I would like to request to add an icon/condition order in this addon that would show you the tick strength of a dot on your target,also with the funktion \"show when dot dmg is &gt; xxxx \". IÂ´m playing a fire mage among others and as a fire mage you have to use your combustion spell when your ignite dot is at highest or at least over a certain amount.<br>I think this would be a great improvement for this class and perhaps others too.</p><p>Is it possible to create and add an icon or condition like this?</p><p>Greetings</p><p>Mindfork</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1156\">#1156</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1156.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-09-06T16:53:58Z","created_at":"2015-09-05T23:26:19Z","updated_at":"2015-09-06T16:53:58Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Check this icon it does exactly what you need.</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^STarget ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SIgnite ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^Sicon1 ^STexts^T ^N1^S ^N2^S[Stacks:VeryShort:Hide(0)] ^t^t^t^SCustomTex^S12654 ^SEnabled^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SDEBUFFTOOLTIP ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&gt;= ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N1000 ^SName^SIgnite ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SShowTTText^B ^t^N73501^S`| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>I have it show the stacks of the current damage on your ignite in a very short display and in the condition I have it only shown at 1k damage</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/InfernalAura\">InfernalAura</a>","created_at":"2015-09-05T23:30:00Z"},{"body":" <p>Thank you very much it works perfectly,didnt know that you could do it like this.</p>\r\n<p>My most profound thanks.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2015-09-05T23:40:38Z"}]}
