{"issue":{"title":"[CF 841] Sorting by duration does not ignore GCD ","body":" <p>This is on version 6.2.1</p><p>In short: Sorting by duration takes GCD into consideration. I do not believe that one usually would want that.</p><p>In long:</p><p>Let Icon 1 be a spell cooldown, Icon 2 a buff.</p><p>Sorting is set to 'duration from low to high' and 'Icon ID from low to high' in this order.</p><p>Let the buff not be present, the spell not be on cooldown.</p><p>Since durations are equal, sorting will be 'Icon 1, Icon 2'.</p><p>While on GCD, sorting will be 'Icon 2, Icon 1' for the duration of the GCD.</p><p>This is independent of the 'allow GCD' option in the timer section.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/tfmm\">tfmm</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/841\">#841</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/841.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-07-13T00:31:39Z","created_at":"2013-07-12T22:07:01Z","updated_at":"2013-07-13T00:31:39Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Thanks.
