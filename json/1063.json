{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1063] Make the icons clickable ","body":" <p>Hello,</p><p>Would it be possible to make the TellMeWhen icons clickable?</p><p>I think it would make the addon even amazier if we could associate an icon with a macro code to be executed when clicking the icon. For example, if we make an icon showing a spell, it would be wonderful if we could click it to actually cast that spell.</p><p>Thank you very much and congratulations for maintaining such a great addon!</p><p>KumoTaicho</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/kumotaicho\">kumotaicho</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1063\">#1063</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1063.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-06T15:41:37Z","created_at":"2015-01-06T15:27:02Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T16:36:25Z","labels":["enhancement","duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Sorry for the duplicate.
