{"issue":{"title":"[CF 129] Undependable condition storage ","body":" <p>Greets,</p><p>Editing the conditions in a cooldown icon sometimes 'sticks' and other times doesn't. Thus far I haven't been able to determine under what circumstances the conditions are or aren't saved; I only know that certain icons do not retain all conditions.</p><p>In reviewing the TellMeWhen.lua file, the text seems pretty straightforward. I also noted that the file is not rewritten until logout. Thus, I saved a copy (TellMeWhen copy.lus) before I logged in, then I made the edits via the interface, chose 'Okay' after making some edits, then reopened to confirm the edits were not saved. After logging out, I made the changes manually to TellMeWhen.lua (see and compare code for Oreslag - Fizzcrank, name = Holy Wrath), logged back in, and checked the icon and the changes were there.</p><p>Consequently it seems that something is wrong between choosing 'Okay' and saving the file at logout, though the behavior is best described as unreliable since I've seen it happen with particular icons I'm setting up, then magically resolve itself in a subsequent edit/Okay iteration. In the case of the referenced code, I was never able to make it save this particular icon, so this is as stable a fault as I can produce.</p><p>Best Regards,<br>Oreslag</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Oreslag\">Oreslag</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/129\">#129</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/129.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-03-03T01:33:20Z","created_at":"2011-02-28T02:33:57Z","updated_at":"2011-03-03T01:33:20Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/171/TellMeWhen.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen.lua</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Oreslag\">Oreslag</a>","created_at":"2011-02-28T02:33:57Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/172/TellMeWhen_copy.lua\" target=\"_blank\"> TellMeWhen_copy.lua</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">TellMeWhen_copy.lua</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Oreslag\">Oreslag</a>","created_at":"2011-02-28T02:33:57Z"},{"body":" <p>This is something that troubled me for a while because I didnt want to create a ton of garbage saving conditions every try, but I have a better solution for condition saving that should solve this problem.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-02-28T05:54:26Z"},{"body":" <p>Let me know if beta3 fixes this</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-03-01T05:59:06Z"}]}
