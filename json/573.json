Prioritizing high duration seems to do just the same as normal prioritization. Oh, and the auras are also coming with a number indicating remaining charges (always 1), which is kind of reduntant for these.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/573\">#573</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/573.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-02T05:23:02Z","created_at":"2012-09-01T20:25:27Z","updated_at":"2012-09-02T05:23:02Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I decided at the last minute to change <code>[Stacks:Hide('0', '1')]</code> to <code>[Stacks:Hide('0')]</code>, because Blizzard is technically supposed to report spells that cant stack as having nil stacks instead of 1 when present. That's why you are getting the 1 on the stack text. You can always set it to hide both 0 and 1 for this specific case.</p>\r\n<p>As for sort not working... activate programmer-who-seems-to-periodically-forget-how-half-his-code-works-while-working-on-it mode.
