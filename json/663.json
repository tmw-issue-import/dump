I made a custom [Name] tag for TMW, but because it lies in TMW's tag namespace instead of DogTag-Unit's namespace, it doesn't have the proper event handling.</p>\r\n<p>The reason this tag exists is because it handles all of the name/class detection magic for class coloring, proper capitalization, etc. especially for icon types that don't report unitIDs (like Combat Event icons). I may just end up deleting it, though, since the only way it could ever work properly would either be by copypasting massive amounts of DogTag-Unit directly into TMW, or through dirty, dirty hacks which should never be discussed ever because programmers everywhere would cry for days upon seeing them.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-10-19T10:01:33Z"},{"body":" <p>Crisis averted in r670, although I did have to use some hacks.
