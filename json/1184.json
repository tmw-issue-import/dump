{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1184] Unit Cooldowns with recharge mechanics ","body":" <p>Greetings, recently i decided to use TellMeWhen instead of Afflicted to track enemy cooldowns in pvp. And i want to ask you for help with a problem.<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/lJT4d/35cb2804d1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/lJT4d/35cb2804d1.jpg</a> - This is example of Afflicted and i want to find a solution for this type of abilities with 2 charges like spirit link or survival instincts.<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/lJU0Y/763839d96d.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/lJU0Y/763839d96d.jpg</a> - This is example of TellMeWhen and you can see that cooldown of ability might overlap<br> on itself and impossible to track both charges at the same time.<br><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/3kD240tC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/3kD240tC</a> - This string describes what i've done.<br>At the end i want you to ask - is it possible to fix the problem of tracking abilities with double charges? And it will be really great if you can help me to make timer look like on Afflicted. I'm using TellMeWhen version 7.4.0.
