{"issue":{"title":"[CF 457] Text Output -&gt; Binding/Label Text ","body":" <p>I have come across a situation where it would be nice to be able to change the Binding/Label Text of the current(or another) icon via a event.</p>\r\n<p>For my example I would like the Label Text on my Wild Mushroom: Detonate to be the current number of active Wild Mushrooms I have.</p>\r\n<p>The way I see setting this up is to have a hidden icon update the text whenever I cast Wild Mushroom. The input would need some way to evaluate some LUA so that the below can be used to grab the number of active Wild Mushrooms.</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\nlocal count=0;for i=1,3 do if select(1,GetTotemInfo(i)) then count=count+1; end; end\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>Another solution to this would be to add a way to evaluate LUA in the existing Binding/Label Text input, however, I'm not sure how often values here are already updated. An option for when to re-evaluate it might be needed with this solution.</p>\r\n<p>In case your wondering why, I don't use the default UI so the bar that normally shows your active mushrooms isn't visible, and I think I'd much rather just have a number that shows the count then the actual bar anyways. I imagine it would be possible to do what I want already, but it would require an icon for each number of mushrooms which is a bit much for a small thing like this.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/pvtschlag\">pvtschlag</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/457\">#457</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/457.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-02T07:23:17Z","created_at":"2012-03-02T19:27:44Z","updated_at":"2012-09-02T07:24:01Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I have been playing around with the idea of using LibDogTag-3.0 for text overlays on icons, which would make this, and many, many other things possible.
