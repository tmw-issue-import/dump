{"issue":{"title":"[CF 835] \"You are not in a raid group\" errors ","body":" <p>TMW is causing \"You are not in a raid group\" errors to be printed under certain conditions.&nbsp; I first noticed it whenever I used reloadui while in a battleground.&nbsp; I get 3 of them each time from TMW, 2 are TMW_CSC_25 messages, 1 is a TMWV message, all 3 trying to go to a non-existent \"RAID\" line.</p><p>Looks like you are checking just IsInRaid() currently, but that returns true while in instances such as battlegrounds and others, even though there is no \"RAID\" line available (unless you are in a real raid before you queue).&nbsp; I believe IsInRaid() should be IsInRaid(LE_PARTY_CATEGORY_HOME)?&nbsp; Same logic would apply to the IsInGroup() checks too, although I don't think that one ends up triggering any error message, so no big deal...</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ywfn\">ywfn</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/835\">#835</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/835.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-07-04T00:06:56Z","created_at":"2013-07-03T09:54:52Z","updated_at":"2013-07-04T06:30:24Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Oh yeah, I should mention that you'll only see the errors while in a party. I guess Blizzard set up the error reporting that way.
