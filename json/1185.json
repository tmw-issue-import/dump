{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1185] Change profile on specialization change ","body":" <p>It would be helpful to be able to separate profiles based on selected specialization. Even though you can do this within the profile itself, it does become a bit cluttered, since you will have to keep separate groups for each specialization in the same profile.</p><p>If you would be able to have a setting to change profile based on specialization for that character, it would make it easier in numerous cases:<br>1. If you have multiple alts of the same class, but you have different specs selected.<br>2. It's easier to maintain and share profiles with others.<br>3. The profiles will become smaller and easier to maintain and update.<br>4. The grouping will be more intuitive</p><p>The specialization settings per group works best for small profiles and/or global groups.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/hiar_nl\">hiar_nl</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1185\">#1185</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1185.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T22:46:17Z","created_at":"2016-01-12T15:27:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T22:46:17Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[]}
