{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1147] Organising groups as a tree view ","body":" <p>Currently when one has many TMW groups, it can get hard to keep track of them all.</p>\r\n<p>I propose a way to form a 'union' of one or more groups and unions, essentially being able to view and organise groups as a tree structure.</p>\r\n<p>The ability to import &amp; export these 'unions' (ie: multiple groups at a time) should also be present.</p>\r\n<p>One should be able to expand/collapse each union, as well as expand/collapse all unions.</p>\r\n<p>Enabling or disabling unions should be possible, without it actually modifying the enabled/disabled states of children groups or icons.</p>\r\n<p>Unions could also have the ability to have group conditions added to them.<br>\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor example, currently a profile has groups such as this:</p>\r\n<p><code>Groups - Profile<br>\r\n.| Group 1<br>\r\n.| Group 2<br>\r\n.| Group 3<br>\r\n.| Group 4<br>\r\n.| Group 5<br>\r\n.| Group 6</code></p>\r\n<p>With the proposed enhancement one would be able to organise the groups as such:</p>\r\n<p><code>Groups - Profile<br>\r\n.- Union 1<br>\r\n.| | Group 1<br>\r\n.| | Group 2<br>\r\n.- Union 2<br>\r\n.. | Group 3<br>\r\n.. - Union 3<br>\r\n.. | | Group 4<br>\r\n.. | | Group 5<br>\r\n.. - Union 4<br>\r\n.... | Group 6</code><br>\r\n<br></p>\r\n<p>The unions themselves need not have any positional data, and serve only to organise the groups easier.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/wormix\">wormix</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1147\">#1147</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1147.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-08-03T06:42:21Z","created_at":"2015-08-02T04:54:03Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T04:45:32Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>look into the META icon type (it's at the very bottom of the icon types list), i think it's fitting the description of almost all of those things listed up there.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 2 2015 00:22:32 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1438492952\">Aug 2, 2015</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Adrian_G2\">Adrian_G2</a>","created_at":"2015-08-02T05:20:31Z"},{"body":" <p>I use meta icons all the time and I don't see how it satisfies any of the requirements of the suggestion.</p>\r\n<p>Using a meta icon as a group controller is one of the reasons I have more groups that I wish to organise.</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nTo be clear this suggestion isn't meant to change how any of the icons or groups are displayed on the screen, only how the groups are presented in the list of groups in the \"Main Options\" tab.</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a thought afterwards that a less robust version of this feature could be achieved automatically based on the anchoring status alone.

I can't see how tucking groups away in nested sets makes it any easier to manage them. Enabling and disabling groups shouldn't be something that you do very often. If you are doing it that frequently to that many groups, you should probably look in to using some group conditions.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-08-03T06:39:07Z"},{"body":" <p>What a shame.
