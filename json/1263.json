{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1263] Text Layout - Unintended Renaming Bug ","body":" <p>When you click inside the rename editbox for a Text Layout and then click on a different Text Layout it copies the name to that layout, (before successfully selecting it).</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. /reloadui, /tmw, right click an icon.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Either click the Layout Settings gear icon beside the icon's current text layout or enter via. General tab &gt; Text Layouts.<br>2. Select a non-default text layout if one isn't already and click anywhere inside the renaming editbox.<br>3. Click a different text layout in the list on the left and it will rename that layout. I haven't tried doing it to a default text layout out of fear and/or laziness. :^(</p><p>Using TellMeWhen version 8.1.1 (also tried it with 8.1.1-11-gda0f7f2)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ghath519\">Ghath519</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1263\">#1263</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1263.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-08-05T04:52:23Z","created_at":"2016-08-03T05:34:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T04:52:23Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
