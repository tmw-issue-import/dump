{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1467] diminishing returns comparison condition ","body":" <p>in pvp, you use different strategy according to the status of diminishing returns. currently only player's buff comparison is possible. I think it's brilliant condition you can set but you cannot compare them between player's and target's. I hope we can see diminishing returns comparison between player and a target at condition section(as well as buff/debuff comparison between player and a target) in the future version thx.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>edit: here's further exposition of why. for example if ur diminishing returns started later than enemy's (say rogue vs rogue) you use vanish for ealier start of ur next stun.(vanish gives you 3 sec of unconditional disapearance and using this you can earn 3 sec for enemy not to start another stun) but if your diminishing returns started ealier than enemy's you can just save it for escaping the fight to reset the combat). if you can track who's diminishing returns ends first, you can make cool tmw icon that recommends proper spells accordingly and this is what tmw is specialized better than weakaura! plz consider this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>and there's another good reason. reuse of your previously set codes. tmw is already offering player's buff comparison. which means, you only need to add a few things(a few, relatively) to the codes. all and all i think it's good suggest.&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daesani00\">daesani00</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1467\">#1467</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1467.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-25T00:51:14Z","created_at":"2018-02-10T19:29:39Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T00:51:14Z","labels":["enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>While an infinitely complex condition system that would make things like this really easy would be cool, its unlikely to happen at this point.
