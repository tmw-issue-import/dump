{"issue":{"title":"[CF 510] Rewrite stance condition ","body":" <p>It sucks. The way that Monk stances work just doesnt work with the current system in place for stance conditions. What really needs to happen is to have text input (with suggestion list) instead of a slider. That way, we don't have to do all kinds of stupid upgrades every time something changes and stances get out of order.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/510\">#510</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/510.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-08-17T22:22:35Z","created_at":"2012-07-08T05:34:57Z","updated_at":"2012-08-17T22:22:35Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
