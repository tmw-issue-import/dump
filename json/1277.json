{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1277] Two Things ","body":" <p>v8.1.2</p><p>Noting this as an enhancement because I'm assuming some are by design.</p><p>1) Before Legion update, if you dragged sliders for group size/position, it'd change in real time. Now you have to let go of the slider before it 'updates' the positioning.</p><p>2) If you get a popup window (<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jHkwPxh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/jHkwPxh.jpg</a> example), it won't go away until you click on an option. Used to go away if you clicked in a null area/hit esc that wasn't TMW related. It goes away after like 5 seconds, but still kinda annoying I guess.</p><p>Also, what's the dogtag for hooking the stacks of a certain buff? It was like...

Updating things as you drag the sliders is hard with the way TMW's sliders work because they adjust their range based on the current value. If you need to fine tune the value and watch it as you adjust, use your scroll wheel (and hold ctrl (x60), shift (x10), or both (x600) to make it adjust faster with your scroll wheel).</p>\r\n<p>2) Yeah, I noticed that the other day. Don't know how I missed that...</p>\r\n<p>Stacks: Don't think there is one. You can always make an icon that will track what you want, and then point TMW's [Stacks] tag at it by passing in the GUID (shift click the target icon to insert the GUID when editing the tag).</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-08-20T04:26:03Z"},{"body":" <p>Yea that's what I'm currently doing for the stacks.
