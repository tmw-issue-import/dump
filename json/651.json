{"issue":{"title":"[CF 651] Absolute Health a pain to configure ","body":" <p>With health now running in the hundreds of thousands creating an absolute health condition for say 100.000 health pretty bothersome. You can get the slider within maybe 2k of the desired number and then have to start scrolling in chunks of 30 to get it to the exact number. It would be great if there was an editbox that allowed an exact number to be entered manually.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/651\">#651</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/651.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-11-02T21:53:58Z","created_at":"2012-10-01T22:03:02Z","updated_at":"2012-11-28T15:54:16Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Finally done.
