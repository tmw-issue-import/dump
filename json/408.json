{"issue":{"title":"[CF 408] Animations not carrying over into metaicons ","body":" <p>I just started toying with animations and immediately noticed that animations aren't shown on metaicons. Since almost every icon I use is element of some metaicon this reduces the usefulness of animations greatly. Also the \"screen: shake\" animation appears to be highly unreliable. I can reliably get the \"screen: flash\" animation but as soon as I change to \"screen: shake\" nothing happens. I have only been able to trigger the animation once, so it doesn't seem to be entirely non-functional.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/408\">#408</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/408.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-01-08T07:37:15Z","created_at":"2012-01-01T08:01:46Z","updated_at":"2012-01-08T07:37:15Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I know.

Or screen animations? It is intended, at least the way that I coded it, that only icon animations are inherited by meta icons. Screen animations will play whenever their event occurs from the icon that they are being triggered by, will play even if the icon is set to always hide, and will play even if the icon is not shown in a meta icon.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-06T23:06:50Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20408%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20408%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>I have two icons with the \"activation border\"-animation, yet the border is present on every other icon aswell.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-01-07T00:26:06Z"},{"body":" <p>try r397</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-07T00:33:21Z"}]}
