{"issue":{"title":"[CF 192] Track Currency ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>4.1.3</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>No errors or anything, and I realize that this addon is mainly for combat conditions. I absolutely LOVE this addon and use it on my paladin, DK, priest, and hunter, which are all the classes I use on any regular basis. Thank you for all your hard work.</p><p>I do have some TMW icons enabled at all times, and as a tank I tend to accumulate a lot of justice points rather quickly. Sometimes I look at my bags and find I have 4k jps and wonder to myself \"How long have I been at the cap?\" I was hoping this addon could be configured to tell me when my jps are over 3750.</p><p>Thanks again!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Bludeye\">Bludeye</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/192\">#192</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/192.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-05-16T02:38:49Z","created_at":"2011-05-07T06:08:54Z","updated_at":"2011-05-16T02:38:49Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The following import string should be what you are looking for (requires r72+)</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon^SConditions^T^N1^T^SType^SCURRENCY395^SOperator^S&gt;=^SName^S^SLevel^N3750^t^t^SName^Spvecurrency-justice^SEnabled^B^t^N414069^^\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-05-15T05:02:37Z"}]}
