Once combat is entered (or maybe someone uses a spell that is tracked) all arena1/2/3 update to the properly tracked auras. At least sometimes, at least.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1113\">#1113</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1113.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-04-28T01:23:54Z","created_at":"2015-04-27T07:46:56Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T01:23:54Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Pretty sure this has something to do with Arena3 auras.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2015-04-27T08:22:32Z"},{"body":" <p>Does it happen all the time?</p>\r\n<p>When it does happen, does it always display things for arena3's class?</p>\r\n<p>This one is much stranger than the last bug...</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-04-27T20:07:49Z"},{"body":" <p>I don't wanna say ALL the time, but more often than not.
