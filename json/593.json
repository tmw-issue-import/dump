I basically have two buttons, one tracking the cooldown of Ice Block of a hostile unit and the other button tracking Cold Snap. I want the timer of button 1 to reset upon activation of button 2. I've tried using the condition \"Icon Shown\" and using the \"failed opacity\", but that doesn't seem to work because the second Ice Block won't show up then. Anyone did something similar to this?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daniel1992\">daniel1992</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/593\">#593</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/593.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-10T20:43:12Z","created_at":"2012-09-06T12:40:36Z","updated_at":"2012-09-10T20:43:12Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Unit cooldown icons should track cooldown resets on their own.

(So, basically, you can delete the cold snap icon now if its only purpose was to try and reset the ice block icon.)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-09-06T21:53:20Z"}]}
