I am aware they have removed the general buff/debuff stack for Arcane Charges, however, considering it's a Resource and that Weak Auras is able to display the \"number stack\" i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 charges (in number form) all i am able to do using any conditions/type of icon is show an Arcane Charge image using a custom texture.</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to reference how Weak Auras does it? That maybe i can get it to show the actual resource charge as a numeric value?</p>\r\n<p>Very best,\r\nMichael</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/veiled9741\">veiled9741</a>","created_at":"2016-10-11T04:41:58Z"},{"body":" <p>Also, reason i say 'reference' is because i love TellMeWhen and I'd prefer to use it over WA</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/veiled9741\">veiled9741</a>","created_at":"2016-10-11T04:43:14Z"}]}
