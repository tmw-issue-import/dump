You could try to make the big group a little smaller of you move some of those icons in the bottom 3 rows and then reduce there number of rows by one or two, but blank icons are already pretty well optimized so this won't make much of a noticeable difference.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-11-26T23:29:37Z"},{"body":" <p>Not much else that can be done. On my machine, the average icon setup time is just a hair over 1ms.
