{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1315] Option for cooldown bars to show charge time rather than/in addition to just cooldown ","body":" <p>On a few different classes now, I've run into situations where I want to set up a bar that would show the remaining time until the next charge of some ability (Shield of the Righteous on my prot paladin, Shadow Dance on my rogue, Fire Blast on a mage, etc) was available (resetting and depleting/filling again once a charge was regained, unless at full charges), but as far as I can tell, this isn't actually possible - a cooldown bar will just show the cooldown when depleted to zero charges.</p><p>The cooldown/charge time sweep on the icon means I have access to the info, but having it in bar form would make it much easier to take in at a glance.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/athalnor\">athalnor</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1315\">#1315</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1315.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-17T06:12:27Z","created_at":"2016-10-12T22:22:14Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T06:12:27Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
