To make it clearer to track, I'm trying to use text manipulators :Floor:SeparateDigits</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Couple months ago it worked perfectly and now those manipulators are simply ignored:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[[10/9] * Stacks]:Floor:SeparateDigits</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please, help me resolve this issue.
