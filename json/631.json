These happened all the way through Cata for me, so the chances are very slim that it will ever get fixed.</p>\r\n<p>Just like the taint issue when removing a glyph - Blizzard's taint catcher picks a random addon to blame, so as far as they are concerned, it is that addon is tainting the UI or otherwise doing things that it shouldn't be doing, even though it isn't. Its either that, or they are completely oblivious that the real problem is actually in their own UI code and not in the code of addons.</p>\r\n<p>TL;DR - unlikely that Blizzard will ever fix it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-09-19T04:42:50Z"}]}
