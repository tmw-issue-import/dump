{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1064] Meta icon priority ","body":" <p>Hello! Thank you for one of the best addons ever made for wow. I have been using TMW for a bit of time now and i find it more and more useful for all kinds of situations. One thing i am missing tho, is an enhanced way of meta icon prioritizing, like for example: (in order of priority)</p><p>Default:<br>Icon 1<br>Icon 2<br>Icon 3</p><p>On condition:<br>Icon 3<br>Icon 1<br>Icon 2</p><p>Maybe this is achievable with longer strains of meta icons, but my problemsolving only goes that far, sorry if this is the case. :)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/shisagi\">shisagi</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1064\">#1064</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1064.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-10T18:45:59Z","created_at":"2015-01-07T20:14:45Z","updated_at":"2015-01-10T18:45:59Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Make 2 meta icon, each with the desired variation on order, and add conditions to those meta icons.
