The only thing wrong with it that I can see is that you have your tags in the text output slightly wrong. Combat Event icons should not use the [Unit] tag - they should use the [Source] and [Destination] tags.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are using the [Source] tag but are not filtering your source by units (you are in this case, so ignore this), you should not use the [Name] tag with it. The same goes for [Destination] - if you are using the [Destination] tag but are not filtering your destination by units (you aren't in this case, so do this), you should not use the [Name] tag with it.</p>\r\n<p>The revised text output should be \"C: [Spell] by [Destination]\". Everything else seems to be working perfectly as you have configured it, so I don't know what the problem is. Perhaps if you tell me what you want the icon to do then I could help you figure out what you need to change.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-04-13T00:20:05Z"},{"body":" <p>Hi</p>\r\n<p>I dont want look when i am interrupted but when I have interrupted <span>:)</span>\r\nI want announce to /say when i have interrupted a spell.</p>\r\n<p>I dont think you are try this one ?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/g0ldo\">g0ldo</a>","created_at":"2013-04-13T11:42:54Z"},{"body":" <p>Edit: i have retry and they are a big misstake <span>;)</span></p>\r\n<p>Your feature is for if u are interrupted: \"My [Polymorph] is interrupted by [Target]'s [Pummel]\"\r\nwork fine any way.</p>\r\n<p>But i dont need it, where is the feature for announce when i have interrupted a spell ?\r\nLike: I have interrupted [Polymorph] on [Target] with [Pummel].</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/g0ldo\">g0ldo</a>","created_at":"2013-04-13T13:43:36Z"},{"body":" <p>You need to set the source unit of the icon to \"player\" then.
