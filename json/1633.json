{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1633] Execute not showing CD ","body":" <p>On my Fury warrior, have Execute selected as a Spell Cooldown option, with both Show Timer and Show Timer Text selected.&nbsp; Since 8.1, it no longer ever shows Execute as being on CD, even when under 20% (ie. when it doesn't have to rely on a Massacre proc).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Digging into it, this might be a Blizzard issue.&nbsp; It looks like macros unconditionally try to cast the Arms version of Execute (163201) rather than the Fury version (5308), making Execute impossible to use in macros for Fury, and GetSpellCooldown(\"Execute\") also seems to always return the Arms version's information.&nbsp; Even GetSpellCooldown(5308) doesn't seem to only sometimes return the properly date (ie. &lt;20%), and at other times return only the GCD length.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Kaedys\">Kaedys</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1633\">#1633</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1633.html\">Raw</a>","closed":false,"created_at":"2018-12-15T22:07:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T00:04:15Z","labels":["cantfix"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Seems to work for me.
