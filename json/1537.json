{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1537] Secondary Resources ","body":" <p>Even with the latest update, certain secondary resources such as Chi, Holy Power, Soul Shards, and Arcane Charges fail to update their values when using the associated DogTag. Combo Points for Feral Druids and Rogues, and Runes for Death Knights seem to work fine, but these other resources don't. The number remains static and only seems to update in-between rounds of combat, but during combat there is no change.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/t3hthing\">t3hthing</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1537\">#1537</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1537.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-08-11T18:18:38Z","created_at":"2018-07-30T15:45:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T18:18:38Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Can't reproduce - all the secondary resource tags appear to work just fine.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-08-11T18:18:38Z"}]}
