{"issue":{"title":"[CF 13] Enable Buttons by default ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind?

The differences between the two versions only included bug fixes and the ability to use multiple buffs per icon.</p>\r\n<p>Even going back to 1.0, Buttons have never been enabled by default (although groups always have been). This is because most buttons don't get used during initial setup, and if they were enabled they'd go solid instead of invisible when the addon is locked. Was there something else specific that you thought should be different?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/TheAtomicOption\">TheAtomicOption</a>","created_at":"2010-04-12T20:28:07Z"}]}
