{"issue":{"title":"[CF 347] Edit box of sharing, what is that? ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Subsequently, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click on the arrow next to the editbox labeled \"Import/Export\". Select the \"To string\" option for the appropriate export type (icon, group, or profile), and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>If you are experiencing errors that seem to be unrelated to icons, attaching a saved variables file (and screenshot if applicable) will increase the likelihood of your problem being solved. Saved variables can be found in: \"World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/&lt;Account Name&gt;/SavedVariables/TellMeWhen. lua\"</p><p>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS WILL RESULT IN YOUR TICKET BEING INVALIDATED.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Paste something into the lower box with the drop down for importing , exporting, etc.<br>2.<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>The examples say to Paste the above string into \"The editbox of sharing...\" and then use the drop-down button on that box to select \"Import from String.\"<br>The upper box for the spell is not it, the lower box with drop down has the drop down only work when nothing is in that box. If I paste the example string I cannot import the string because the drop down menu no longer works.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
