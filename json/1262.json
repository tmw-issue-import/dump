{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1262] Tracking Rain of Fire - Destro Lock - pls help! ","body":" <p>Hi<br>I've been using tmw almost as long as I've been playing wow. But I'm finally stumped by something!<br>I'm trying to set it so that it will track the duration of Rain of Fire (which is currently 7.4secs). I have managed to get it to track the cast (which is 1.39 secs), but that's not what I want it to show. I want it to show the same way that I get my debuffs like immolate to show, but I'm totally out of ideas. I've played about with the settings as much as possible, but still cant seem to get the right combination for this to work. It wont track like a buff or debuff on either the player or the target (I guess because its an aoe), but I cannot for the life of me figure out the correct combination of settings. So any help or advice would be very much appreciated.<br>Many thanks in advance :-)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/karen1nicola\">karen1nicola</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1262\">#1262</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1262.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-08-05T01:25:35Z","created_at":"2016-08-02T03:17:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T01:25:35Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Hi again\r\nI've actually managed to find a way to get it to \"sort of\" work, by setting it as an \"internal cooldown\" icon, adding the duration after the : , and setting the timer to start after the cast, and ticking \"don't refresh\".\r\nIf there is a better way though, I am all ears!\r\nBut doing it this way means there's no text on the bar. (for example, my debuff tracking of immolate actually shows the word \"immolate\" in the bar, which I like) - so if this is the only/best way to do this, then how do I add text back to the bar to say \"rain of fire\"?\r\nCheers again</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/karen1nicola\">karen1nicola</a>","created_at":"2016-08-02T03:33:53Z"},{"body":" <p>You can set the icon type to combat event. spell name rain of fire. source unit player. event type spell cast success. timer to set on event 7.4 seconds.
