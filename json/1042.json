{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1042] TMW Dissapears Even in Locked Mode ","body":" <p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Similarly, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Backup\". Select the \"To string\" option for the appropriate export type for your issue, and then press CTRL+C to copy it to your clipboard.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. /tmw to lock tellmewhen<br>2.<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>I expect the icons to remain on the screen and then activate the CD timer when I use an ability. Instead, they disappear and do not function when I use an ability. I would like to have them visible all the time, even when not usable. But it seems to be doing the opposite for some reason.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
