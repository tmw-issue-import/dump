{"issue":{"title":"[CF 32] Rip, Rake and Savage Roar not displaying ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Adding Rip, Rake and Savage Roar in the same way I did pre-patch(debuff, on target(for the bleeds, for the Roar its buff, player), when present, show timer, only if cast by self)<br>2.<br>3.</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?<br>Expected output: seeing the 2 bleeds and the Roar when they're on the target/me with a timer<br>Output: Nothing</p><p>What version of the product are you using?<br>Curse Client and WoWmatrix say TellMeWhen 1.5.3, so I guess thats it</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>Nope, doesn't show any error. The built-in \"bleed damage increase\" thing works perfectly fine, but these 3 don't.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/fly835\">fly835</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/32\">#32</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/32.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-11-06T17:39:25Z","created_at":"2010-11-05T18:25:22Z","updated_at":"2010-11-06T17:39:25Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I may have messed up the alpha settings when you upgrade to 1.5.3.
