As I had suspected, your settings were corrupted when you disconnected. There is a chance that any addon's settings will be lost when you improperly close WoW, especially if you improperly exit WoW after being disconnected in order to try to get back into the game faster, or even if you just simply disconnect.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is not with TellMeWhen, but with the way that WoW saves addon settings. The only way to recover your old settings will be to restore them from a backup if you have one. If you do not have a backup, then unfortunately, you will just have to re-configure everything.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-03-11T23:27:34Z"},{"body":" <p><cite>@<a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20461%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybeloras</a>: <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%20461%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go</a></cite></p>\r\n<p>Ah okey, the thing is I didnt configure anything at all when I installed the addon.
