{"issue":{"title":"[CF 984] New Condition 'Buff - Seen' ","body":" <p>Condition for whether or not a certain buff as been seen (at least once). Useful for something like a placebo to track enemy talents in arenas, IE if it has 'seen' Blood Horror, then it knows to enable or disable a certain icon based on condition. Might also be useful for Spell Casts or something.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/984\">#984</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/984.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-08-18T21:36:31Z","created_at":"2014-08-16T18:39:31Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T21:36:31Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I would never make this into a condition because it has to be reset at some point, and that's not something that can be configured nicely for a condition.</p>\r\n<p>You can do it with a Combat Event icon with a long timer. Or a Unit Cooldown icon, for that matter. A Unit Cooldown icon would actually work better since it resets the cooldowns of enemies when an arena game starts.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-08-17T04:46:09Z"}]}
