Going into Void form and casting Void Bolt will not trigger the timer on the TMW icon.<br>2. Trying to track without conditions does not rectify issue.<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>Expect the void bolt to show when in void form and after entering void form, expect the Void bolt icon to have the spell cool down timer when void bolt is used. Icon shows in voidform but no timer when used.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>8.0.3</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>No</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p><p>Manged to get a \"fix\" when writing this up. When I replace tracking the spell cool down of void bolt with void eruption it works.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Lockpocket1\">Lockpocket1</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1244\">#1244</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1244.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-24T01:44:16Z","created_at":"2016-07-23T23:51:54Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T01:44:16Z","labels":["defect","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Tracking Void Eruption is the correct way to track this.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-24T01:43:31Z"}]}
