{"issue":{"title":"[CF 562] Ignore GCD or not per icon ","body":" <p>I set up an icon to sit on top of my GCD spark and display Ravage when I have feral Incarnation up. I'd like to be able to have that Ravage icon show my GCD, but it seems the only way to do that is to enable every cooldown icon to show the GCD. Could this be added at the per-icon level of configuration, rather than the per-profile level?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Halsey1006\">Halsey1006</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/562\">#562</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/562.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-10T20:52:16Z","created_at":"2012-08-30T20:44:43Z","updated_at":"2012-09-10T20:52:16Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is actually something that I've been wanting to do for a while now since the icon editor actually has room for it now.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-30T22:41:20Z"},{"body":" <p>Added in for both cooldown sweeps and timer bars in r596</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-09-10T20:52:08Z"}]}
