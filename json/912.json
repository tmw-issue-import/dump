The purpose of the currency conditions was to add an easy way to notify you when you have hit, or are arbitrarily close to hitting, the cap on one of your currencies like Honor or Justice. If you would like to see exactly how much you have then you should just open up your character pane and check. If you use a LDB client addon like Titan Panel or FuBar then there are plenty of plugins to show your currencies as well: <a href=\"http://www.curse.com/search/addons?game-slug=wow&search=currency\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.curse.com/search/addons?game-slug=wow&amp;search=currency</a></p>\r\n<p>There might be a currency icon type at some point in the future, but I wouldn't count on it happening any time soon.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 13 2014 15:55:42 (CDT) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1389650142\">Jan 13, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-01-13T21:54:39Z"},{"body":" <p>I understand this to some extent. Since the actual value is being fetched anyhow I thought maybe it could be implemented.

There are already quite a few things in TMW that, in hindsight, I would have rather not ever implemented. Colors are one of them. DogTag, although it is vastly superior to TMW's old, pathetic dynamic text system, is another - there are a plethora of issues with it that make it a bad fit for TMW, but unfortunately, there is no better system out there at present without writing my own.</p>\r\n<p>Adding these as an extension of DogTag itself (as opposed to the TMW-specific tags that TMW adds) would be possible, but it is a pretty inactive project at this point and creating an entirely new library just for currency DogTags might be a bit overkill. I can give you a Lua snippet for TMW that will add a currency DogTag when I get home today.</p>\r\n<p>The ultimate dream would be to have a unified system of data sources that can be implemented as icon types, as conditions, and as text substitutions (like DogTags), but that would be such a huge undertaking and I'm not sure I have enough time to do something like that anymore.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 14 2014 12:15:31 (CDT) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1389723331\">Jan 14, 2014</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2014-01-14T18:07:52Z"},{"body":" <p>Import this snippet to get a currency DogTag.
