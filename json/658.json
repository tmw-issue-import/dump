{"issue":{"title":"[CF 658] Saving data fails ","body":" <p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>I configure TellMeWhen - copy some group from another character into current one, then I make some changes to this group (lots of). Everything works as intended. I get a critical error (unexpected shut down of the client). I start WoW client once again. Almost all data is lost - I see the copy of the group without any changes applied.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>6.0.3</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>No lua errors. Just critical error of the client.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p><p>I guess you keep data in local variables until the legal shut down of the client when all data is stored. I suggest to save the data immediately after applying changes or at least every X minutes.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/CuteBunny\">CuteBunny</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/658\">#658</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/658.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-10-08T23:21:48Z","created_at":"2012-10-08T21:30:05Z","updated_at":"2012-10-08T23:21:48Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That's not how WoW works.
