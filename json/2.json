{"issue":{"title":"[CF 2] Conditions for showing icon groups ","body":" <p>I just tried TellMeWhen and I'm very fond of it, but as I prefer to show \"when absent\" and \"only show in combat\", it's showing my cat requirements (e.g. Rip) when I'm in Bear form and vice versa.</p><p>For Druids (and maybe other classes too) it would be great to add conditions when to show the icon groups.</p><p>The most simple way I could think of woule be to link the \"active\" setting to a buff.</p><p>e.g. show icon group 1, condition: \"Dire Bear Form\" is active<br>and show icon group 2, condition: \"Cat Form\" is active</p><p>I think Warriors would also like it, for stances (which are not buffs), maybe DKs depending on their aura (which are buffs), and so on</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/dieck\">dieck</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/2\">#2</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/2.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-03-13T19:53:29Z","created_at":"2009-01-29T21:02:01Z","updated_at":"2010-03-13T19:53:58Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is all part of stance/form/presence support that I'm hoping to have time for eventually.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/TheAtomicOption\">TheAtomicOption</a>","created_at":"2010-03-13T19:53:58Z"}]}
