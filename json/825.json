{"issue":{"title":"[CF 825] Range condition ","body":" <p>There currently only exists the condition to check the range to another unit via a spell. Sadly my warrior doesn't have any spell that has a range of 40 yards, except for vigilance, which I rarely use. Now my raidframes can reliably change the opacity of players coming in and going out of 40 yards range. Wouldn't this also be possible for TellMeWhen?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/825\">#825</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/825.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-06-27T23:38:42Z","created_at":"2013-06-21T16:34:16Z","updated_at":"2013-06-27T23:38:42Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You need to use an item range condition.

It is the way that librangecheck-2.0 works. There aren't any conditions that use LRC-2 because it can only be approximate (it gives a min-max range that a unit is within) and I'm not sure how to elegantly implement that into a condition.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-06-22T02:13:50Z"}]}
