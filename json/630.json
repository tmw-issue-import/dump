{"issue":{"title":"[CF 630] Renewing Mist Tracking ","body":" <p>Thank you for your continued hard work, I have a Renewing Mist request in the spirit of the mod \"Renewing Mist Watcher\" (<a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/renewingmistwatcher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/renewingmistwatcher/</a>).&nbsp; I would like an icon or set of icons to display two things.&nbsp; The shortest amount of time left on any of my Renewing Mists on party or raid targets, so I know when to either Uplift or Thunder Focus Tea, and the number of active Renewing Mists on party or raid members so I can Uplift or TFT for the greatest effect.&nbsp; This can either be two icons which individually track either request, or single icon with stack size in the middle and either a border that indicates the last few seconds or an additional timer above or below.&nbsp; Thank you again.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Adapted\">Adapted</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/630\">#630</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/630.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-04-21T22:13:39Z","created_at":"2012-09-18T19:27:48Z","updated_at":"2013-04-21T22:13:39Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This should do the trick for the shortest duration on party and raid members: </p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SUnit^Splayer;~`party;~`raid ^SSort^N-1 ^SType^Sbuff ^SUnAlpha^N0.3 ^SName^SRenewing~`Mist ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SEnabled^B ^t^N60410^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p>\r\n<p>Tracking the total number is going to require a special icon type to be made.
