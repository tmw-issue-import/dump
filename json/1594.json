{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1594] Update explanation for 'Unit Specialization' condition ","body":" <p>Unit Specialization condition will properly work with your focus IF the focus unit is one of the 3 things Unit Spec can work with, IE player/arena1-5/battleground enemy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The current explanation does not make this distinction, would be nice for other players if this was added. I assume this works because I guess instead of it considering the focus a separate unit entirely, it in a sense \"copies\" the unit from the original source and refers everything to that one unit.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1594\">#1594</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1594.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-10-12T03:39:55Z","created_at":"2018-10-11T03:13:17Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T03:39:55Z","labels":["enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Seems correct to me:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>This condition ONLY works for:</p>\r\n<p>- Yourself<br>- Battleground enemies<br>- Arena enemies</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>If your focus is a battleground enemy, it will work.
