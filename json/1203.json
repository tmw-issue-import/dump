{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1203] Make bars show party-members target hp and name. ","body":" <p>I feel like that can be done somehow. Make bar emulate party-members target unit frame.

Work pretty good. Im also wonder is there is a way to make bar color the same as target class color. I see there is custom texture option, Maybe there is a way to use texture with condition. I probably just can create the icon for every class with [class object=%] conditions, but that's alot of groups, maybe there is easier way, shortcut. Also thank you very much for answering all my questions, I really appreciate it!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Hearthstonemakesmemad\">Hearthstonemakesmemad</a>","created_at":"2016-05-04T11:31:38Z"},{"body":" <p>Added class coloring to bars in the next Legion build</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-17T00:58:25Z"}]}
