{"issue":{"title":"[CF 768] Reverse Cooldown Sweep/Desaturate Icon ","body":" <p>Going to just make two suggestions in one so I don't make too many tickets.</p><p>1) Reverse the cooldown sweep so it'll \"make more sense\" based on what it's tracking.<br>2) Desaturate an icon, for something like an ability on cooldown or a trinket on ICD. Would be nice.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jastain\">Jastain</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/768\">#768</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/768.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-03-18T06:54:32Z","created_at":"2013-03-18T06:45:02Z","updated_at":"2013-03-18T06:54:32Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Cooldown sweep is already reversed based on icon type.</p>\r\n<p>Options for desaturation are available in TMW's color options (The option is named \"Grey\")</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-03-18T06:54:21Z"}]}
