{"issue":{"title":"[CF 866] Decimals when changing parameters ","body":" <p>Note for invalidation: I saw a bug report in the closed section and realised it has already been reported.</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create an icon.<br>2. Create or go to any parameter with an adjustable slide and change it while still having the mouse click held down. You'll see numbers (when normally there wouldn't be any e.g Solo, Party, Raid? Will show 0.382345348574 or 1.238473847534) with 10+ decimals. If you let go it'll return the appropriate parameter value you stopped at.</p><p>A breakdown would be Create icon &gt; go to conditions &gt; click to add a condition &gt; player attributes &gt; instance type &gt; click and hold and move parameter slider and Solo will change to 0.019385384573~ and when you move it to 1.03492385835 and let go Solo will change to Party.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>This started happening a few patches back, I can't remember which specifically. But it should not show decimals when changing parameters but even then 10 decimal places is a bit much.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</p><p>6.2.6</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>No.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p><p>Export string of profile as it applies to every parameter I intend to change, even newly created ones.</p><p>[Export string deleted]</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/felrece\">felrece</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/866\">#866</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/866.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-09-28T16:34:05Z","created_at":"2013-09-28T16:30:16Z","updated_at":"2013-09-28T16:35:59Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>oh, lawl, is the edits public?
