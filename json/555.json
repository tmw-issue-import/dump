{"issue":{"title":"[CF 555] Feature Request: Time Icon Hidden/Shown Comparison ","body":" <p>Can you please make a brand new condition:</p><p>Icon &lt;Icon Selection&gt; Is &lt;Shown|Hidden&gt; For &lt;Equal|Not Equal|More|More or Equal|Less|Less or Equal&gt; &lt;X&gt; Seconds</p><p>It requires creation of a timer for each icon which resets each time the icon changes its state between shown and hidden. These timers should ignore Always Hide icon option.</p><p>It would be also really nice to provide 2 functions which return these data:<br>1. getIconShownTime('&lt;group_name&gt;/&lt;icon_name&gt;') which returns amount of time in seconds (with 1-2 digits after comma) the icon was shown if it's actually shown or 0 otherwise.<br>2. getIconHiddenTime('&lt;group_name&gt;/&lt;icon_name&gt;') which returns amount of time in seconds (with 1-2 digits after comma) the icon was hidden if it's actually hidden or 0 otherwise.</p><p>Thanks in advance. These conditions are going to be so much helpful!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/CuteBunny\">CuteBunny</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/555\">#555</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/555.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-11-05T21:43:41Z","created_at":"2012-08-29T23:25:41Z","updated_at":"2012-11-05T21:43:41Z","labels":["enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added these as conditions in r638.

You absolutely do not have to apologies, it is not a commercial project and noone is allowed to blame you. I was pretty sure that you are not going to implement this so it makes me pretty much happy and surprised to see that this ticket is resolved. Thank you one more time, gonna test it as soon as I get home.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 5 2012 15:43:41 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1352151821\">Nov 5, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/CuteBunny\">CuteBunny</a>","created_at":"2012-11-05T12:41:46Z"},{"body":" <p>As I have promised, I've done some little tests. I've created two icons. The second one is \"Always hidden\" and has one simple condition \"when 1st icon is hidden\". The first icon is being displayed and has the following conditions: \"when 2nd icon is shown &gt;= 0.5 seconds\" or \"when 2nd icon is hidden &lt;= 2 seconds\". I predicted a few possible bugs but suddenly it happened to work properly: the icon was showing up for 2 seconds then disappearing for 0.5 seconds and then over and over again in infinit loop.
