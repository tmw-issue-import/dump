I enable it for my Rebirth cooldown on Tellmewhen for raid chat.<br>2. Rebirth is used.<br>3. In a later attempt, someone dies and they call for a brez.<br>4. I right-click Rebirth's Tellmewhen button and it says \"Time on rebirth: 2m\".</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Aisenfaire\">Aisenfaire</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/476\">#476</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/476.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-02T02:57:32Z","created_at":"2012-03-30T05:45:07Z","updated_at":"2012-05-02T02:57:32Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added support for this in r502:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Added On Left Click and On Right Click event handlers to icons.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Just add an event handler in the Events tab that will output the desired text.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-02T02:57:26Z"}]}
