To be frank, I'm not very familiar with these things.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, the issue was occurring in the beta, and only on my druid (shaman and paladin worked just fine). By the looks of it, the ticket Wytheron linked describes the problem I had as well. Unfortunately I'm unable to link the saved variables, as I deleted all TMW -related files in an attempt to fix the issue. If it's any help, deleting the the druid's own saved variables file wasn't enough to fix it.</p>\r\n<p>I do have lua errors enabled; no errors occurred.</p>\r\n<p>A complete re-installation of the addon seems to have fixed it, though.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ethak\">ethak</a>","created_at":"2012-08-10T14:07:40Z"},{"body":" <p>Cause of issue was discovered.
