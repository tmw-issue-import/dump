{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1181] Check for a spell cast on anyone in raid with a condition ","body":" <p>Hi, I'd like to ask some advice on how to set up an anti-grieving icon that would report when someone in raid cast Leap of Faith on another player in raid and the target of that spell was not in combat.</p><p>So far I'm setting up a Combat Event icon with both Source and Destination set to \"group 1-40\". I tested it without the \"target is in combat\" condition and it's working the way I want it to. The problem is, I don't know how to add that condition. If select Unit Attributes &gt; Unit in Combat, the Unit box only accepts a single unit, not multiple units like \"group 1-40\". Do I need to use a custom LUA condition for that?<br>Thank you.</p><p>Here's my icon so far:</p><p>^1^T^SType^Scleu ^SUnitConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCLASS2 ^SBitFlags^N16 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SCLEUDur^N10 ^SName^SLeap~`of~`Faith ^SShowTimerText^B ^SSourceUnit^Sgroup~`1-40 ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SAnnouncements ^SChannel^SSMART ^SText^S[Spell]~`was~`cast~`on~`[Destination:Name]~`by~`[Source:Name]! ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N2^T ^SType^SAnnouncements ^SChannel^SSAY ^SText^S[Spell]~`was~`cast~`on~`[Destination:Name]~`by~`[Source:Name]! ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N3^T ^SType^SAnnouncements ^SChannel^SRAID_WARNING_FAKE ^STextDuration^N10.5 ^SText^S[Spell]~`was~`cast~`on~`[Destination:Name]~`by~`[Source:Name]! ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N4^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SDuration^N10 ^SAnimation^SICONSHAKE ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^Sn^N4 ^t^SCustomTex^S73325 ^SCLEUEvents^T ^SSPELL_CAST_SUCCESS^B ^t^SEnabled^B ^SDestUnit^Sgroup~`1-40 ^SUnit^Sgroup~`1-40 ^t^N74003^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nordveien\">nordveien</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1181\">#1181</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1181.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-12-02T05:53:00Z","created_at":"2015-11-26T11:46:06Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T05:53:00Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I got it backwards and closed this ticket while shouldn't have.
