{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1081] Add Dialog to sound channel ","body":" <p>Dialog is a new sound channel added in MoP and I would love to use that as the TMW sound channel. I normally use Ambient so I can increase the TMW volume as high as possible without affecting my gameplay, but I'd rather not hear ambient sounds and my dialog is already really high to hear bosses dialog.
