{"issue":{"title":"[CF 80] show/hide groups when in vehicle ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?</p><p>Right now an icon group can be shown or hidden based on combat status.&nbsp; I'd like to see another option for icon groups based on whether or not you are in a vehicle.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>We can already show/hide icons based on being in a vehicle, so this request may seem redundant.&nbsp; Here's why I'd like to see this added:</p><p>1)&nbsp; IMO, combat &amp; vehicles are perhaps the 2 main \"states\" that you can be in.&nbsp; Driving a vehicle completely changes what abilities you can use.&nbsp; It would be much easier to set this for an entire icon group instead of having to add a condition to every icon.&nbsp; I think this is a state where you will probably want to use it for every icon in a group rather than just 1.</p><p>2)&nbsp; Adding background frames under the TellMeWhen icons using kgPanels (or similar) is a great way to help make the icons stand out.&nbsp; You can make them show/hide by making TMW or other frames parents.&nbsp; This doesn't work well by parenting an icon since it will show/hide based on cooldown status.&nbsp; It does work well with combat status since you can parent the TellMeWhen_Group# frame &amp; check the \"show only in combat\" option for that group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because showing based on vehicle status is in the icons themselves, you can't use vehicle status for the kgPanel frame's parent.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Vardelm\">Vardelm</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/80\">#80</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/80.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-01-09T04:04:20Z","created_at":"2011-01-03T18:48:17Z","updated_at":"2011-01-09T04:04:20Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/190/kgpanels_tmw_example.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> kgpanels_tmw_example.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/190/kgpanels_tmw_example.jpg\" title=\"kgpanels_tmw_example.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/190/126/126/kgpanels_tmw_example.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">kgpanels_tmw_example.jpg</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;example of kgPanels under TMW&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Vardelm\">Vardelm</a>","created_at":"2011-01-03T18:48:17Z"},{"body":" <p>Great idea.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"01 3 2011 16:52:42 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1294095162\">Jan 3, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-01-03T22:45:55Z"}]}
