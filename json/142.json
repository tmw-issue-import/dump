In my mage I use it to track mana gem cooldown, showing me the icon when the mana gem is available, it works great until I run out of charges, then the icon remains visible where I'd like it to not show because well, I can't use it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Beruchan\">Beruchan</a>","created_at":"2011-03-18T15:06:54Z"},{"body":" <p>Thank you!
