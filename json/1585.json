You could&nbsp;<em>probably</em> get something about right by stringing together the Unit Range condition in multiple conjunctions with Arena1/2/3 (I assume you want this for arena if you're the same Talason as I think you are).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sarena1 ^SLevel^N7 ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^t^N2^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sarena2 ^SLevel^N7 ^t^N3^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sarena1 ^SLevel^N7 ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N4^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sarena3 ^SLevel^N7 ^t^N5^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sarena2 ^SLevel^N7 ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^SAndOr^SOR ^t^N6^T ^SType^SLIBRANGECHECK ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sarena3 ^SLevel^N7 ^t^Sn^N6 ^t^SCustomTex^SThrash ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^SEnabled^B ^t^N85501^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Something kinda like this. I don't know LUA so I assume you could make something much better and much cleaner looking if you did. Might need to crank the range on each condition down to 6 since like I said before, addons gleaning precise range information can be fucky, so it's best to set it on the lower side. If you wanted to add a condition so it's not just up any time people are in range, I'd probably move all the range related conditions to the group conditions then change the icon conditions to something like \"debuff duration on A12/3/ &lt;= 4s\" or something like that.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2018-09-26T09:53:25Z"},{"body":" <p>This condition type is covered in my addon which is complementary to TMW - <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tellmewhen_script_tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">TMW_Script_Tools</a> (among other things).
