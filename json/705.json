The buff that you mentioned is indeed the correct one. It is called \"Flashfreeze\" and it has a spellID of 126478. The tooltip may appear incorrectly because of the way that buffs like this scale with level. That doesn't mean that it is the wrong buff.</p>\r\n<p>If you notice that you gain a buff called \"Flashfreeze\" when you use this trinket, then typing \"Flashfreeze\" as the buff to be checked by the TMW icon will cause it to be tracked correctly. What you see is what you get when entering spells into TellMeWhen - there is no hidden data or extra information that is included when you select something from the suggestion list. The suggestion list is just there to make entry of spells easier.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-11-23T08:19:33Z"}]}
