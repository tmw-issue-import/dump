I tried to follow your instructions but I am hopelessly confused. Should I make a new group with one icon in it, or should I change my existing fire and brimstone icon to meta. Should I make a group with two icons and make one meta and the other conditional? As you can tell I am totally inept at this and would need exact instruction in order to succeed. </p>\r\n<p>I very much enjoy using your add-on and appreciate the time you put into this.
