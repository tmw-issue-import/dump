{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1252] Hunter pet cc tracking not working patch 7.0 ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Track 'pet' buffs/debuffs and the abilities I select are 'rooted', 'slowed', 'incapactitated' etc.<br>2. Last patch it would track when my hunter pet was slowed or stunned etc. but since 7.0 went live it no longer tracks the cc on my hunter pet. Not sure if Dire Beast is confusing it or if something else has changed in 7.0<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>See point 2. above</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>8.1.1</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>No error - just no showing the cc on my hunter pet</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/icehawk15\">icehawk15</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1252\">#1252</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1252.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-30T00:58:04Z","created_at":"2016-07-26T03:23:13Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T00:58:04Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>All sorted. Sorry for the inconvenience. Seems the update must have made it track buffs. Just clicked it to debuff and now it works. All good.
