{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1451] Prot. Warrior Victory Rush ","body":" <p>Greetings,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Spell Cooldown or Reactive Ability icon of TMW for the Victory Rush of Prot Warrior does not work. It's supposed to be active after killing an opponent. But the TMW icon is always on even when the Victory Rush is not available.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I use TMW v8.4.2 and the following is the string export of the TMW icon. Thank you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bong</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Sreactive ^SShowTimerText^B ^SName^S연전연승 ^SClockGCD^B ^SEnabled^B ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N2^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^N3^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^N4^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^N102^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^t^SOnlyActvtnOverlay^B ^SUseActvtnOverlay^B ^t^N84201^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/BongKim\">BongKim</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1451\">#1451</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1451.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-02-01T04:55:08Z","created_at":"2017-11-25T18:44:09Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T04:55:08Z","labels":["cantfix"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The icon is only as good as the data it gets from Blizzard's API.
