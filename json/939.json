{"issue":{"title":"[CF 939] Tracking Enemy Totems ","body":" <p>To whom it may concern.</p><p>I hope this is the correct place to ask this information. But what I am after I cannot find anywhere on the net or an example of it.</p><p>What I want to be able to do, is track a certain enemy totem. In my case, I want Tell Me When to pop up the icon for when an enemy shaman (target or focus) has a grounding totem down. I am unable to work out how to use Tell Me When to do this for me. I have Tell Me When tracking everything else I need, but I just can't get it to track an enemy totem.</p><p>I have asked on the WOW Forums, and someone did try and help, but it doesn't seem to work for me either, and I don't understand the coding of it.

I tried importing that code and seemed to have some success in that it appeared to recognise that it was a grounding totem I was trying to track, but when the time came to track a grounding totem, it didn't appear to work. I took some screen shots of what I imported and how it is set up, but the 3rd attachment you will notice when tested, I couldn't get it to work. It should be showing in the bottom - centre near where it's tracking the druid buff, but it doesn't. What you see in the top left corner is \"Lose Control\" which seems to detect grounding totem.</p>\r\n<p>Is there something I have not done correctly? Maybe the icon I didn't correctly import? I couldn't find at first where to import the icon, but then I found somewhere to import it as an icon. If you could assist in getting this Grounding Totem tracking working, that would be greatly appreciated. I also apologise in advance if I have missed something simple. I can make \"Tell Me When\" do whatever I need it to do if it's a simple buff I'm tracking, but this LUA code seems very hard for me to work out and understand for some reason.</p>\r\n<p>Your assistance / help would be much appreciated.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/arcticwolf15\">arcticwolf15</a>","created_at":"2014-04-15T02:48:13Z"},{"body":" <p>In your screenshot, you appear to be testing with friendly players, but the code is specifically written to only track totems cast by enemies.

It's good for arena, as it will track either a Target or Focus grounding totem. But in a bg, it still detects grounding totems, but it's not dependant on Target or Focus. It seems to detect any enemy grounding totem in the vicinity whether I'm targeting the shammy or not.</p>\r\n<p>Is there anyway to make it specifically detect only Target or Focus enemy grounding totems? I'm sorry it's taken a while to respond. I haven't been usuing my hunter as much and haven't as many opportunities to detect grounding totem as I would have liked.</p>\r\n<p>If there is a way to track only Target or Focus enemy grounding totems that would be great.</p>\r\n<p>So just to re-cap - this does track enemy grounding totems, but it doesn't appear to be specific for Target and Focus totems.
