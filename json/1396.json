I won't add features to it - it does not allow distinguishing of unit sources. source is not a valid parameter for that tag.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you want to see all if your UAs, Make a buff/debuff icon for UA, put it in its own group, and make it a group controller. You'll get an icon for each UA present. configure the icon appropriately to only check for your own UAs.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-08-06T04:31:17Z"}]}
