{"issue":{"title":"[CF 346] executing lua code for conditioning ","body":" <p>I´m trying to build a tell me when based dps priority button that shows the ability a specific class such as priest should use basing on simulationcraft/elitistjerks. I´ve tried to include lua code into a condition icon but \"If...then\" does not work (tmw actually tells me it won´t work in the tooltip). Can anybody describe in short form how I would do something like</p><p>vampiric_touch,if=(!ticking|dot.vampiric_touch.remains&lt;cast_time+2.5)&amp;miss_react</p><p>in lua? I get the duration and actual cast time from this:</p><p>_, _, _, _, _, duration, expirationTime, _, _, _, _ = UnitAura(\"target\",\"Schattenwort: Schmerz\",\"player\")<br>_, _, _, _, _, _, castTime, _, _ = GetSpellInfo(34914)</p><p>It would help if somebody could explain how to inlcude this via the tell me when conditions.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mawo\">mawo</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/346\">#346</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/346.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-12-01T01:15:57Z","created_at":"2011-11-24T18:40:25Z","updated_at":"2011-12-01T01:15:57Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I don't know what miss_react is, so I will just ignore that part.</p>\r\n<p>This should do what you want:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n(select(UnitAura(\"target\",\"Schattenwort: Schmerz\",\"player\"), 7) or 0) - time &lt; (select(GetSpellInfo(34914), 7) + 2.5)\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-11-24T19:57:45Z"}]}
