{"issue":{"title":"[CF 258] Show keybinds ","body":" <p>I love all of the amazing flexibility updates you've done to TellMeWhen over the last 6 months. Seeing the changes actually brought me back to using it and I am in love.</p>\r\n<p>I was inspired by Aliena (of Tankspot.com) to have my most useful cooldown icons showing in the middle of my screen. Instead of using PowerAuras, however, I wanted to accomplish the same thing with TellMeWhen. It has worked amazingly well!</p>\r\n<p>Now for the reason I'm posting. I used to look at my action bar buttons to see cooldown timers and remind myself of the keybind. Now that I'm using TellMeWhen to accomplish this task I realize I'm missing the keybinding reminder <span>:-(</span></p>\r\n<p>Is there a way for you to either add auto detection of keybindings (I know some addons use LUA strings to accomplish this) or add the ability to add custom text to the buttons and attach it to a certain spot?</p>\r\n<p>Love your work!!</p>\r\n<p><em>Mistariah of US-Earthen Ring</em></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>I had this idea a while back too and want to implement it.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/258\">#258</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/258.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-07-16T08:11:46Z","created_at":"2011-07-16T08:11:46Z","updated_at":"2011-07-16T08:11:46Z","labels":["defect"]},"comments":[]}
