This is the number that is sent to other users of TMW to tell you that there is a new version. if you would like to see who the version checks are coming from, type \"/run TMW.debug = 1\" as soon as you log in. Once you get a version warning from someone, you will see something like this:</p>\r\n<p>TMW: TMWV M:4.1.4^m:^R:414069^ GUILD Cybeloras</p>\r\n<p>The last thing there is the name of the person that the version warning came from.
