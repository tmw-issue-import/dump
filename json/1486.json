{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1486] BATTLE FOR AZEROTH VERSIONS ","body":" <p>If you're looking for BFA-compatible versions of TMW, look no further.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, with all the features that Curse/Twitch/Amazon has removed from Curseforge, including multiple repository forks each with their own file sets, it won't be easy like it was in the past.

I'm not sure what you mean by stack trace; the closest thing I found was a frame stack? Here is a picture of what happens, with a frame stack of the icon. The icon itself just doesn't work; if I log out and in it disappears (and all the other groups are still stuffed until I delete it).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QvSZtIj.jpg\"></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Using resources as a condition or notification filter seems to not work in some cases; runes, combo points and holy power all don't seem to function as far as I can tell (can't set icon visuals based on these resources). \"Check for resources\" on the main icon still works and will change the color/alpha of the icon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Obviously can't use buffs and debuffs as notification/condition rules, I assume that's the same problem as the icons not tracking them either.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When right click dragging icons, no position indicator is visible like it used to be. It still works, can still move/switch/whatever via right click drag, but no indicator of current position during drag.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is this sort of stuff helpful and is this the right place to put it?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/user_976011\">user_976011</a>","created_at":"2018-05-02T22:59:08Z"},{"body":" <p>Just to be sure, you downloaded the latest code from <a href=\"https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/archive/bfa.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ascott18/TellMeWhen/archive/bfa.zip</a>, right?
