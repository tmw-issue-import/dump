{"issue":{"title":"[CF 105] ICD Option ","body":" <p>So with the new ICD module, what i'd like is the ability to;</p><p>display the icon for the buff when the trinket proc is active, allowing for a timer which shows when it is up and going to expire</p><p>when the trinket is on ICD, an icon displayed for showing how long until the ICD ends (a different icon, if possible, maybe the icon to match the trinket instead of the buff?)</p><p>possibly a different display to highlight when the trinket is ready to proc, but has not yet procced?</p><p>At the moment I can kind of get there by using two different icons, but stacking them on top of each other so that the buff always shows when its up by being on top of the icon telling me its on internal cooldown. Combining this into one would make the tracker awesome.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/warriorjedi\">warriorjedi</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/105\">#105</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/105.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-01-28T04:37:37Z","created_at":"2011-01-28T00:22:56Z","updated_at":"2011-01-28T04:37:37Z","labels":["invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Forgot to say that, as it is at the moment doing it this way and trying to use the same icon for the same spell means that at a glance it can look like you have the trinket proc up, when really its telling you that there is time left on the ICD.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/warriorjedi\">warriorjedi</a>","created_at":"2011-01-28T00:25:23Z"},{"body":" <p>Use a meta icon.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-01-28T04:37:19Z"}]}
