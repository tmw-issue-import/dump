{"issue":{"title":"[CF 64] more debuff conditions ","body":" <p>What is the enhancement in mind? How should it look and feel?</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.</p><p>Hello, I do not know if this is possible, but could you add conditions for say if a curse/poison/magic effect/disease are on you? as a ret paladin to see cleanse pop up when needed would be really great. Also show on buff timer x (inquisition 6 seconds, display) things like that. One last one, possible to overlay a character onto the icon, for example \"1\" to represent to the player, \"I should press 1 to do that\"</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/stonechitlin\">stonechitlin</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/64\">#64</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/64.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-12-20T20:14:20Z","created_at":"2010-12-13T18:09:51Z","updated_at":"2010-12-20T20:14:20Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I was just thinking about this a little bit ago, and yes, it is possible.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-12-14T05:21:22Z"}]}
