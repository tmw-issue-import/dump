So I'm unsure if this feature will just be depreciated until it will be filled (it's on his todo list, so that's something).</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2013-09-10T22:00:56Z"},{"body":" <p>TellMeWhen doesn't actually interact with ElvUI. ElvUI hooks into the cooldown sweep code and creates a timer on top of the cooldown sweep whenever a cooldown starts. The option in TMW to enable/disable the elvUI timer actually just sets a single variable that disables the timer when the setting is unchecked. When the setting is checked, it is as if nothing had ever happened. It is up to ElvUI to make its timers work when the setting is checked (enabled) in TellMeWhen.</p>\r\n<p>OmniCC works in the exact same way except for the fact that OmniCC allows the timer text to still be shown when the cooldown sweep is hidden. It just uses a different variable than the one used by ElvUI which is why it is possible to have separate settings for the two addons.</p>\r\n<p>TL;DR - not an issue on TMW's end. Thanks for letting me know about it, though, since I'm sure there will be other people reporting the same issue in the coming days.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 10 2013 19:02:27 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1378857747\">Sep 10, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-09-11T00:00:51Z"},{"body":" <p>I have added some code in 6.2.5 that will make ElvUI aware of TellMeWhen's timers.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-09-13T19:33:49Z"},{"body":" <p>It seems that ElvUI has stealthily done away with its check for cd.noOCC so it is no longer possible to disable the ElvUI timers in TMW.
