{"issue":{"title":"[CF 349] Redirect (PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED Event) ","body":" <p>i am trying to set up a redirect icon whenever the spell is off cooldown and my target has changed. maybe there is a cleaner way to check for cp on the lasttarget and somehow link this to the condition. as of now i think i might need to add the above mentioned event into the conditions lua check, but i can't seem to make it work. thanks for your help!</p><p>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOMBO ^SUnit^Starget ^t^N2^T ^SType^SSPELLCD ^SName^SRedirect ^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SEnabled^B ^SName^SRedirect ^t^N46705^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/yeahno\">yeahno</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/349\">#349</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/349.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-11-27T20:21:19Z","created_at":"2011-11-26T14:01:09Z","updated_at":"2011-11-27T20:21:19Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>There is no surefire way to check for combo points on your last target because it probably won't have a unitID associated with it.
