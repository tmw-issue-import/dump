{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1056] LUA Errors (Group Controllers?) ","body":" <p>Was playing around with group controllers last night, seeing how they worked and using them to clean up some real estate for my TMW setup when in config and whatnot.</p><p><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/1nKU1Dad\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/1nKU1Dad</a><br><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/k64jmTQE\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/k64jmTQE</a></p><p>From what I can tell, the LUA error prevents the group controller from populating the group with the referred icons, and also seemed to prevent the icons from having timers on them. Both issues are intermittent. Sometimes it'll work on one arena frame and not the other.</p><p><a href=\"http://puu.sh/e0uXt/5e8dae56c6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/e0uXt/5e8dae56c6.jpg</a></p><p>Example in top left of screen. Top left is the icons being referred to the group controller. The icons at their referred point (attached to arena frames) don't show the proper cooldowns as the original icons before referring (top left).</p><p>Can upload my auras as needed.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1056\">#1056</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1056.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-06T01:49:41Z","created_at":"2015-01-03T08:29:59Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T01:49:41Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Also, I dunno if this is relevant or news to you, but disabling a global group isn't actually global.
