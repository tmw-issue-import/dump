{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1461] unit cooldown cooltime customization ","body":" <p>first of all the fact that you can set up \"fake cooldown for every spell\" in the unit cooldown section is really cool. I use this option to track enemy spell which is an instant spell with no cooldown such as \"mutilate\" by giving 1 min fake cooldown. it gives me a lot of option in many ways. thank you. but you cannot track cooldown correctly if a spell has charges. hope we can get enemy spell charge tracker in the future.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daesani00\">daesani00</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1461\">#1461</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1461.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-02-01T04:15:26Z","created_at":"2018-01-31T18:38:37Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T04:15:26Z","labels":["duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Duplicates <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201184%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1184</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This isn't something that's likely to ever be implemented.
