{"issue":{"title":"[CF 785] Version notification improvement ","body":" <p>TellMeWhen is currently notifying for all revisions detected higher than the present one. The fact is seen in TMW:OnCommReceived().<br>However, some players prefer Release version, and some players prefer Alpha or Beta. For majority players who is using Release, which is the default preference of Curse Client, they will get version notification from Alpha users.
