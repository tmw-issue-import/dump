{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1464] Stacks of Dire Beast - How to Display ","body":" <p>Hello,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'd like to display how many stacks of Dire Beast are active at any given moment. I'm not sure how to do this. I'm able to show the icon when a Dire Beast is active, and even show a zero in the middle of the icon. But i'm not able to show how many stacks are currently live.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've explored a few option and messed around, but have gotten nowhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any help would great!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/jaikusif\">jaikusif</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1464\">#1464</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1464.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-04-02T00:08:41Z","created_at":"2018-02-08T21:02:46Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T00:08:41Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You can make a controller group that will show an icon for each active dire beast you have.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\n\n```\n^1^T^SGUID^STMW:group:1QmNHEdlyDKv ^SIcons^T ^N1^T ^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SDire~`Beast ^SShowTimerText^B ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^SEnabled^B ^t^N2^T ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N3^T ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N4^T ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^t^SControlled^B ^t^N84305^S~`~| ^Sgroup^N18 ^^\n```\n</div> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-04-02T00:08:41Z"}]}
