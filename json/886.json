{"issue":{"title":"[CF 886] Sliders Ignoring Stepping, Reporting Raw Values ","body":" <p>Well, I looked through the closed tickets first and found some previous tickets about this. I'm going to submit it anyway, though, just because of what I said at the bottom: Nevcairiel said that it was fixed in Ace3, so it shouldn't've required anything of you, should it have? And, moreover, why am I not seeing the fix? I changed it to an \"Other\" so as to not be so accusative.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>What steps will reproduce the problem?</strong><br>\r\n<strong>1.</strong> Add a Condition, e.g. Instance Type.<br>\r\n<strong>2.</strong> Drag the slider.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</strong><br>\r\nI feel like I remember it jumping to the slider steps before. Now it's moving fluidly until you drop it and then it \"snaps\" to whatever step is nearest.<br>\r\nDuring the fluid movement, it shows the full floating point value for the position of the slider.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
