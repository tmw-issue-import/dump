{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1111] Searing Totem range ","body":" <p>Hey Cy - hope you are well!</p><p>Leveling my shaman finally and I use the Totem tracking option to see if totems are down. Works perfectly for almost everything. My only little pet peeve at the moment is that if I drop a searing totem - it detectcs if it is in range of me the player, but not the mob (40 yards max).</p><p>So if I drop a searing totem, kill a mob then move on to another mob maybe 10 yards above, it still shows me in range of the Searing totem, but the mob is out of the 40 yard attack range so it just does not attack. Also can occur on a movement heavy fight if I don't position it well.</p><p>Hope that makes sense. I tried tinkering with some of the pet settings etc. but no luck yet. Even if it cannot be addressed directly, an option to perhaps check if this one totem is within say, 5 yards of the player. I'm sure you have some better ideas to tweak this a bit.</p><p>Thanks as always!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/maven1979\">maven1979</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1111\">#1111</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1111.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-04-19T07:09:20Z","created_at":"2015-04-18T12:31:00Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T07:10:03Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It isn't possible to track this due to API limitations.
