{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1050] Track cooldown of Soulburn: Summon Fel hunter ","body":" <p>Hello,</p><p>I was wondering if it's possible with TellMeWhen to track whether a soulburn is used on summoning a fel hunter or observer? I was thinking you could check if it was instant cast or not, because if it is, it goes on a cooldown for 60 seconds, otherwise it has no cd because you summon the pet by casting.</p><p>My idea was :<br>Combat event<br>Spell cast succesful : summon felhunter (60 second cd)</p><p>and then add some condition that checks if it was instant cast or not? (but couldnt find any condition like that but i properly overlooked something)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mileyzor\">mileyzor</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1050\">#1050</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1050.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-12-22T23:15:45Z","created_at":"2014-12-20T03:54:43Z","updated_at":"2014-12-22T23:15:45Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Are you wanting to track if you cast it?

The second icon is just a helper for the first, and can be placed anywhere (it will never show).</p>\r\n<p>If you want to restrict the units that will trigger (only hostile units, for example), then set up some exclusions for the source unit on BOTH icons (If they're different it won't work).</p>\r\n<p>If you want to do something when this happens like play a sound or output some text, add an On Show trigger to the appropriate notification type on the first icon.
