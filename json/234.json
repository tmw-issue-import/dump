{"issue":{"title":"[CF 234] Unit Cooldown does not reset upon entering arena ","body":" <p>I track different enemy cooldowns on arena1-3 ( which works really great with the new cooldownlength enhancement you put in, thanks alot), but if i face the same team twice in a short time the cooldowntracker won´t reset. it doesn´t reset the cooldowns of tracked units upon entering the arena (perhaps you don´t know this: if you enter an arena match, all your spells reset their cooldowns in order to have everything ready when the match starts)</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. use the unit cooldown feature tracking cooldowns of arenaenemys.<br>2. face a team twice within a short period of time (shorter than the length of the tracked cooldown)<br>3. cooldowns won´t reset, tmw counts down the normal cooldown lenght, but entering the arena resets all cooldown once</p><p>german wow client, tmw 4.4.0</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Rhyn23\">Rhyn23</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/234\">#234</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/234.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-07-16T08:15:26Z","created_at":"2011-06-21T21:47:26Z","updated_at":"2011-07-16T08:15:26Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added in r141 or something.
