{"issue":{"title":"[CF 576] Leader of the pack not counting for crit buff ","body":" <p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>I made a big bar of all the new shared buffs and they all worked perfectly except when I was on my feral druid, being in feral form applies the \"Leader of the pack\" buff which is one of the \"crit\" category buffs but the addon did not seem to notice it was there. To temporarily remedy this I put \"IncreasedCrit; Leader of the Pack\" in the spells-to-check box and that seems to work fine. Cheers</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
