{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1170] Sniper Training Notify if &lt;= 3 seconds only ","body":" <p>So I have been trying to get Sniper Training for MM hunters to do the following:</p>\r\n<p>If sniper training is counting down and it is less than or equal to 3 seconds then trigger a notification to \"STOP MOVING\". Ignoring sniper training recently moved as that is not part of my notification.</p>\r\n<p>I have the text notification working great except for one issue...</p>\r\n<p>If I stop moving before 3.5 seconds (spell countdown is a 6 second timer) so let's say I stop moving at 5 seconds... it still warns to STOP MOVING even though I have it set to only trigger at 3.5 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>If I continue to move, it does trigger at the 3.5 second mark just fine and does not trigger at &gt; 3.5 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is I do not want it to ever trigger from 6 to 3.5 seconds regardless if I am moving or not. Only if the timer is 3.5 seconds or less AND I am moving do I ever want it to trigger the event notification.<br>\r\nHere is my exported string </p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SName^SSniper~`Training;~`Sniper~`Training:~`Recently~`Moved ^SShowTimerText^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOMBAT ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^Sg^N0 ^SType^SAnnouncements ^SChannel^SRAID_WARNING_FAKE ^SOnlyShown^B ^SShowIconTex^b ^STextDuration^N5 ^SText^S[Icon(\"Interface\\TargetingFrame\\UI-RaidTargetingIcon_8\",~`size=0)]~`STOP~`MOVING~`[Icon(\"Interface\\TargetingFrame\\UI-RaidTargetingIcon_8\",~`size=0)] ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^Sb^F7912206404164647 ^f-58^SOnConditionConditions ^T^N1^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SLevel^N3.5 ^SName^SSniper~`Training ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^t^N2^T ^SType^SSPEED ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^SOperator^S&gt; ^t^N3^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S~|= ^SAndOr^SOR ^SName^SSniper~`Training ^SPrtsBefore^N1 ^SLevel^N3.5 ^t^N4^T ^SType^SSPEED ^SPrtsAfter^N1 ^t^Sn^N4 ^t^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^STMW:textlayout:1KKorxEdbsA3 ^STexts^T ^N2^S[Stacks:Hide(0)] ^t^t^t^SEnabled^B ^t^N74003^S~`~| ^Sicon^^\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>so basically if I am at 6 - 3.5 seconds regardless of moving or not (basically don't do anything if the time is greater than 3.5 seconds) then do not trigger notification to stop moving</p>\r\n<p>If I am at 3.5 - 0 seconds AND moving then trigger notification to stop moving. If I am not moving it is really irrelevant because it would trigger the movement at 3.5 seconds anyway and not repeat. so the only crucial element is to not trigger anything between 3.5 and 6 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a screenshot of the event condition</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4tBB7PY.jpg\" alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/4tBB7PY.jpg\"></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/transitbus\">transitbus</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1170\">#1170</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1170.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-10-22T19:16:59Z","created_at":"2015-10-22T18:14:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T19:19:41Z","labels":["invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Figured it out finally. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VAHbuAK.jpg\" alt=\"http://i.imgur.com/VAHbuAK.jpg\"></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/transitbus\">transitbus</a>","created_at":"2015-10-22T19:19:41Z"}]}
