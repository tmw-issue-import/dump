{"issue":{"title":"[CF 28] shadow priest - mindblast / shadoworbs ","body":" <p>hi,</p><p>at first i want to say that tellmewhen is one of my favorite addons, i really love how simple and easy configurable this addon is.</p><p>my situation:<br>i'm playing a shadowpriest and with the cataclysm patch a lot in my skillbook has changed. i have a chance to get a stack of shadoworbs on my char everytime my shadowword:pain or mind flay deals damage to my target. every stack of shadoworbs i have, increases the damage of my mindblast. in many forums&nbsp; i read, that mindblast should on only be cast when the maximum of 3 stacks of shadoworbs is reached, but then with a very high priority.<br>at first i used your addon to keep track of my shadoworb stacks and the cooldown of my mindblast with two seperate tellmewhen icons. then you implemented the new functionality called conditions.</p><p>here ismy improvement suggestion:<br>i would be a huge improvement for me, if i could add a condition to my mindblast icon, that it should only be shown, when the mindblast cooldown is ready and the maximum number of shadoworb stacks (3) is reached. maybe there are other classes, that would benefit from this new function, too.</p><p>thanks for your time<br>nobbworld</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nobbworld\">nobbworld</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/28\">#28</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/28.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-11-12T02:12:18Z","created_at":"2010-11-01T12:41:12Z","updated_at":"2010-11-12T02:12:18Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is something that I would consider for a future version, but there are much more pressing issues right now.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-11-04T03:29:30Z"},{"body":" <p>okay, but thanks for the answer</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nobbworld\">nobbworld</a>","created_at":"2010-11-04T12:32:26Z"},{"body":" <p>FYI, I also play a spriest and you're supposed to cast MB on CD, not wait for 3 orbs.</p>\r\n<p>in fact, I would not track shadow orbs at all.</p>\r\n<p>Also, your mind blast button should be highlighted when you get 3 orbs by default UI. I've noticed if you use a macro it does not light up Mind Blast. this is probably some blizzard bug.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 11 2010 18:38:21 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1289522301\">Nov 11, 2010</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/adezero\">adezero</a>","created_at":"2010-11-12T00:19:03Z"}]}
