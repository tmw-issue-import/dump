{"issue":{"title":"[CF 382] change tint on icon borders ","body":" <p>oxboy555</p><p>Cyb, the new color enhancements are great.&nbsp; Is there a way to change tint on icon borders?</p><p>Cybeloras</p><p>Are you using Masque? There is no way to modify the borders if you aren't because there aren't any actual borders. I suppose I could add support for changing the border color for Masque-skinned icon, but it isn't a top priority.</p><p>Do you want the border to use whatever color the icon is using? - That would actually be extremely easy to implement.&nbsp; Having a separate color for the icon and the border would take much more time.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/382\">#382</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/382.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-12-19T08:35:53Z","created_at":"2011-12-14T23:49:00Z","updated_at":"2011-12-19T08:35:53Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <ul><li>Added an option to color the border of Masque skins with the coloring applied to icons.
