Blizzard does not support checking if a unit is within X number of yards - you can only check if some spell or item is in range of the unit, and you can also only use spells/items that can be cast/used on that unit (E.g. you cannot check if a hostile target is in range of a bandage, because bandages can only be used on friendly targets.)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-12-13T23:48:47Z"}]}
