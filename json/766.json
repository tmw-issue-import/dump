{"issue":{"title":"[CF 766] Rain of fire tracking ","body":" <p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>6.1.5</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)</p><p>This one has me a lil' stumped. I've tried tracking spell cast and other things that work for most situations but I just cannot get the icon to do anything, so am looking for some assistance. Rain of fire for Destruction warlocks is just a click and cast now, not channeled. Once you click and target an area it casts for roughly 7 seconds (haste affects it) but it is not a toggle, which is where I am not sure what to do. I don't need to know when it is casting necessarily, but want to have a reminder to know after roughly 7 seconds of a cast to cast it again.</p><p>Thanks!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Maven79\">Maven79</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/766\">#766</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/766.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-03-18T07:02:13Z","created_at":"2013-03-17T12:35:12Z","updated_at":"2013-03-18T07:02:13Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Also had one quick question.
