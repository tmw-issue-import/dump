However, the alpha flash animation governs the opacity of the icon. A zero opacity icon with an alpha flash animation with opacity 50% is going to fade between 0% and 50%, and when the ability comes off cooldown, this will be between 50% (the opacity of the animation) and 100% (the ready-state opacity of the icon).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any animation on an icon with an indefinite duration is going to play indefinitely. Its just that most of them aren't visible when the icon has 0% opacity, with the sole exception of the alpha flash animation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, you either need to add another trigger on the icon to stop the animation when the icon hides, or (and I recommend this option) change the animation trigger to a While Condition Set Passing trigger and set the trigger condition to check the cooldown of the ability in question.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-07-03T07:39:15Z"}]}
