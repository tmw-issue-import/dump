{"issue":{"title":"[CF 669] Dire Beast Uptime Tracking ","body":" <p>Hey so I can't seem to be able to create a icon with tracking for Dire Beast the Hunter spell. I have tried both debuff and buff even though it isn't either of those as well as combat event spell summon and create for pet. I may be just missing something entirely but is there a way to track the uptime on this spell, and by that I mean the duration the beast is up. Thanks</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Rasca1\">Rasca1</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/669\">#669</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/669.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-10-22T16:56:51Z","created_at":"2012-10-22T14:46:48Z","updated_at":"2012-10-22T16:56:51Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This is the icon that I use for this:</p>\r\n<p><code>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Sicd ^SShowTimerText^B ^SName^S120679:~`15 ^SShowWhen^N1 ^SUnAlpha^N0.5 ^SEnabled^B ^SICDType^Sspellcast ^t^N60345^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</code></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/forum/general/25135-how-to-import-strings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/forum/general/25135-how-to-import-strings/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"10 22 2012 09:55:22 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1350917722\">Oct 22, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-10-22T14:55:09Z"},{"body":" <p>Awesome ty</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Rasca1\">Rasca1</a>","created_at":"2012-10-22T15:12:24Z"}]}
