{"issue":{"title":"[CF 777] Addition of condition to check if inventory item has activation ","body":" <p>I was trying to add a generic CD timer for trinkets and couldn't find a way to check if the trinket in a given slot had an on use activation.<br>It would help me out if there was a condition to check if an item had an on-use activation.<br>I think via GetInventoryItemCooldown(player, 14) it can be checked, where the 1st and 3rd return parameters would be 0 if the no item was equipped or if the item had no CD (and thus will most probably not have an on-use ability).</p><p>I also noticed that I couldn't reference items in conditions via the slot number (e.g. 13 or 14 for trinket slots), but this might be an oversight on my end.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/salp\">salp</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/777\">#777</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/777.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-04-15T23:24:38Z","created_at":"2013-04-06T16:58:19Z","updated_at":"2013-04-15T23:24:38Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>This, as a Lua condition, should work just fine:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\nGetItemSpell(GetInventoryItemID(\"player\", 13))\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-04-06T17:19:38Z"}]}
