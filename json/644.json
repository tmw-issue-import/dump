{"issue":{"title":"[CF 644] Condition Resources: Percent Rage ","body":" <p>Warriors got a new glyph that allows the ragebar to extend to 120 rage. Because of that I believe it would be best for the condition Percent Rage to accept an absolute value instead of a percentage and it should accept numbers up to 120.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/644\">#644</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/644.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-09-28T02:10:58Z","created_at":"2012-09-27T17:22:51Z","updated_at":"2012-09-28T02:10:58Z","labels":["defect","declined"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Just the existing absolute rage and max rage condition would need to be changed.

You should be able to adjust the slider for these up to 120.
