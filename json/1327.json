{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1327] Show dot strength icon not working ","body":" <p>Hi,</p><p>i would like to report a problem with the dot strenght tracking. I want to use an icon where i track the strength of my dots when they are below a certain value, but it seems that tmw cant track the current dotvalue. It should be working like: when my dot e.g. rake is e.g. &lt;=30.000dmg show the icon (this should also include if the dot isnt up,because not being up would mean a value of 0.,right?)</p><p>I am using this icon with TMW version 8.2.0:</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^Starget ^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SDEBUFFTOOLTIP ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N30000 ^SName^SRake ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SShowTTText^B ^SName^SRake ^SEnabled^B ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N2^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N82008^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>I was also testing: Debuff - Aura Variable and Debuff - Tooltip Number #1 - #3.

In your case, it is going to be comparing against the number 3, since that's always the second number in Rake's tooltip. Tooltip Number #1 is the one that you want here, and it works great. When the condition fails, the Failed Conditions opacity level is used on the icon. I have no idea what \"ignoring the condition option\" means.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-10-28T02:43:53Z"}]}
