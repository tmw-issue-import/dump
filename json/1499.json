{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1499] Overwrites Profiles ","body":" <p>Hi guys,</p>\r\n<p>it's the fourth time that happens to me. Every time I change my character (therefore also the profile)&nbsp;the last created profile overwrites all those before.&nbsp;I do not know what to do. It's frustrating. Thanks in advance for your reply.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/n3utro\">n3utro</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1499\">#1499</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1499.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-05-28T10:01:06Z","created_at":"2018-05-24T10:58:52Z","updated_at":"2018-05-28T10:01:06Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I'm going to need more detail than that to help here. What do you mean by \"last created profile\"? Are you manually creating profiles yourself? Or are you just using the default, per-character profiles that are automatically created for you? Any other information that you can provide would also be helpful.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-05-25T17:42:18Z"},{"body":" <p>Ok, i'll give you an example. My last created character was a monk and when I created his profile (I was very careful to create a new profile called \"monk\")&nbsp;all the spells that I set went to overwrite the profiles \"war\" \"rog\" \"mage\" ecc.. So when i login &nbsp;with another character i saw \"monk\"'s spells. On all other profiles!! Help me plz.
