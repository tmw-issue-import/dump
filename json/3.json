{"issue":{"title":"[CF 3] monitor energy/runic power/mana ","body":" <p>I have a three part feature request. 1) I'd like to see energy monitored, ie I could set up a sinister strike icon and tell it at what energy I want the icon to appear. 2) I'd like to also monitor combo points for similar reasons. which brings us to 3) an ability to meet more than one condition.. ie enough energy to use eviscerate and 5 combo points on the target.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mstrjonathan\">mstrjonathan</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/3\">#3</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/3.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-03-13T20:00:00Z","created_at":"2009-01-30T11:50:50Z","updated_at":"2010-03-13T20:04:18Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>1. Min/Max thresholds sound like a good idea. I know as a warrior that could be useful for heroic strike/cleave as well. Mana of all types is not supported at this point. I believe Power Auras can do it.</p>\r\n<p>2. Combo points are on the fringe of the scope of this addon. Adding them as an option to make things pop when they change might be good though. </p>\r\n<p>3. All currently available conditions can be setup independently. I'll definitely be keeping this flexibility with any new features that are added.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/TheAtomicOption\">TheAtomicOption</a>","created_at":"2010-03-13T20:04:18Z"}]}
