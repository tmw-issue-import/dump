Are you wanting icons that display each the debuff on each person? Then make a buff/debuff icon on the first icon in a group (i.e. iconID 1), and then set it as the group's controller (at the top of the icon editor). Configure it as needed to track the debuff you want on the units you want.</p>\r\n<p>If you only need text output when the debuff is applied, use a Combat Event icon configured to watch for the Aura Applied event, with \"raid\" as a destination filter. Use the Combat Event trigger for your text notification.</p>\r\n<p>You can't do this with TMW 5.0.2, though. You will definitely need to upgrade - that version is over three years old.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"04 26 2015 22:36:44 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1430105804\">Apr 26, 2015</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-04-27T02:09:36Z"},{"body":" <p>Let's take an example:</p>\r\n<p>I want to show the names of the players affected by a debuff from a boss (like Ultraxion) at the same time, like that :</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n[raid]: &lt;Fading Light&gt; on &lt;Jack&gt; and &lt;Paul&gt;\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>Also, i want to show the time remaining of the debuff :</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n[raid]: &lt;Fading Light&gt; on &lt;Jack&gt; and &lt;Paul&gt; : 6/6 sec\r\n\r\n[raid]: &lt;Fading Light&gt; on &lt;Jack&gt; and &lt;Paul&gt; : 5/6 sec\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n[raid]: &lt;Fading Light&gt; on &lt;Jack&gt; and &lt;Paul&gt; : 1/6 sec\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>Thanks.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"05 3 2015 08:11:02 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1430658662\">May 3, 2015</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/akreem\">akreem</a>","created_at":"2015-05-03T13:08:49Z"},{"body":" <p>You can't do this, and you <em>definitely</em> can't do it with version 5.0.2.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-05-03T17:47:57Z"},{"body":" <p>Even with the last version ?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/akreem\">akreem</a>","created_at":"2015-05-04T21:25:37Z"}]}
