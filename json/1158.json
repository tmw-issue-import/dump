{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1158] adding group controllers to group meta icons ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Creating a meta icon as a group controller.<br>2. Attempting to add a non-meta icon that is a group controller to the meta icon.<br>3.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>For the meta group controller to pull information from the icon group controller. It ignores pulling any additional information from the icon group controller aside from the first icon in the group.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>v7.3.5</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?<br>No.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>I want to effectively have a meta icon that'll be able to sort through multiple things and have different icons attached to it.</p><p>Instead of individually creating each icon and adding it to a meta icon(as there are 50-100 different things to add)</p><p>i.e. making a group controller that specifically monitors crowd control that you want timer text on, and having it be in the same displayed group as slows but without timer text.</p><p>As monitoring different buffs/debuffs for multiple targets requires you to have 1 for each specific target, as a result, 10 crowd control abilities can equal out to 50 different icons having to be made (target, focus, arena1-3) along with the meta icon and it's group... as well as having to add said 10 icons to each group instead of adding them as a group controller.</p><p>This would allow you to also modify particular groups to do certain things while appearing under the same group (having different colored borders/timers for different abilities) and such. Instead of 6 additional groups track say physical, magical, and disease, poison, curse/dot abilities.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ayiu\">Ayiu</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1158\">#1158</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1158.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-09-14T23:30:40Z","created_at":"2015-09-14T23:24:03Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T13:35:59Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Working as intended.
