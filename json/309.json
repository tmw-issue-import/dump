{"issue":{"title":"[CF 309] 'Check activation border' doesn't work ","body":" <p><strong>What steps will reproduce the problem?</strong><br>\r\n1. Be a warrior.<br>\r\n2. Import the following: </p><div><div><div>\n\n```\n^1^T^SType^Sreactive ^SIgnoreNomana^B ^SName^SRevenge ^SEnabled^B ^SUseActvtnOverlay^B ^t^N46205^S~` ^Sicon^^\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p> 3. Block an attack while in Battle or Berserker Stance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</strong><br>\r\n'Check activation border' is supposed to make this button appear as usable when the button is highlighted yellow, regardless of stance. I clearly see the shiny yellow border around Revenge, however, the TellMeWhen button does not appear as it should. The same is true for Overpower.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)</strong><br>\r\nMade sure this bug was still active with r260. It is.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you have an error log of what happened?</strong><br>\r\nThere is no Lua error.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/daeger\">daeger</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/309\">#309</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/309.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-10-14T05:38:49Z","created_at":"2011-10-14T04:37:13Z","updated_at":"2011-10-14T05:38:49Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
