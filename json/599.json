{"issue":{"title":"[CF 599] Target of unitID ","body":" <p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to make something similar to Gladius` TargetBar, showing the target (class icon) of arena1-3 (or any other unitID such as party1-3). What I have tried to do:<br>Make a condition icon, using the condition \"Unit Class\". However there is no unitID for target of a specific unitID. So basically my question is: is there a way to have a condition for a certain unitID`s target?</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
