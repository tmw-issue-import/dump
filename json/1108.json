{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1108] Wind Shear not counting as interrupt spell? ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. I use the icon below to track interrupts in an interrupt rotation, namely, I put a player's name in who is supposed to interrupt right before me.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>Usually it works fine, but when I tried to put a shaman's name in, the icon wasn't showing. Though the shaman did successfully interrupt a spell multiple times (as could be seen in logs). Shaman's name was suggested in TMW's tooltip on the right hand side and picked from there, so it wasn't a possible misspelling issue.</p><p>I guess as a workaround I could use Spell Cast event and specify spell name each time as well in addition to player's name (haven't tried it yet).</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>7.3.0 r16 (g54a0c0c) - as it shows in game.</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>^1^T^SCLEUEvents^T ^SSPELL_INTERRUPT_SPELL^B ^t^SType^Scleu ^SSourceUnit^SGrandissimo ^SCLEUDur^N3 ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SAnimations ^SDuration^N1.5 ^SMagnitude^N5 ^SAnimation^SICONSHAKE ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N2^T ^SFade^b ^SType^SAnimations ^SSizeX^N50 ^SPeriod^N0 ^Sa_anim^N1 ^SImage^S1766 ^SSizeY^N50 ^SAnimation^SICONOVERLAYIMG ^SEvent^SOnShow ^SInfinite^B ^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^STMW:textlayout:1Kr7UmB1BFsC ^STexts^T ^N1^S[Red~`\"Mine's~`Next\"] ^t^t^t^SCustomTex^Snone ^SUnit^Sraid ^t^N73011^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>^1 ^T^N1^T ^SShadow^N1.5 ^SJustify^SLEFT ^SName^SMoK ^SSize^N26 ^t^SGUID^STMW:textlayout:1Kr7UmB1BFsC ^SName^SPlainTextBIG ^t^N73011^S~`~| ^Stextlayout^STMW:textlayout:1Kr7UmB1BFsC ^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/nordveien\">nordveien</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1108\">#1108</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1108.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-04-24T16:36:20Z","created_at":"2015-04-17T22:32:22Z","updated_at":"2015-04-24T16:36:20Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>That icon isn't enabled.
