{"issue":{"title":"[CF 679] Additional holy power requirements check ","body":" <p>As holy pala I'm trying to check holy power, to cast a spell (let's say word of glory) at 5 holy power, but see faded icon at 3 and invisible if lower.

You can move it where ever you like. I added holy power counters to the icons - you can remove these in the Text Displays options for each icon if you do not want them. I also removed the second condition that was on your original icon. If you want it back, you should probably add it to the meta icon.</p>\r\n<p>As always, let me know if you need any more help with this, or with anything else!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-11-03T02:12:28Z"}]}
