{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1311] Track companion pets health ","body":" <p>Hello, I'm pet-battling a lot in Legion, and I created a TMW that tracks \"Revive pets\" if I have the Safari Hat buff.</p><p>But, I would like to track it only when my pets are not at 100% health. I've searched the conditions several times and I did not find any related to companion pets. I don't think they're implemented.</p><p>It is a very minor feature but it would made my life easier :)</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/JabboHunter\">JabboHunter</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1311\">#1311</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1311.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-09T19:07:29Z","created_at":"2016-10-04T07:34:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-09T19:07:29Z","labels":["enhancement","declined"]},"comments":[]}
