Let's clarify: if icons do ignore GCD like you said then they should NOT disappear on GCD. Right? But they actually DO.</p>\r\n<p>Simple test: create warrior, create \"Spell Cooldown\" for \"Battle Shout\" with \"Usable\" option checked. Go to dummy and hit \"Mortal Strike\". \"Battle Shout\" icon will disappear and appear again in 1.5sec.</p>\r\n<p>That's doesn't makes sense. While GCD is active you have 1.5 sec to choose next spell to use. But how can you choose spell if it is hidden by GCD's \"not available\" ?</p>\r\n<p>That's in MoP. Maybe it works fine on live.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 12 2012 11:07:35 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1344787655\">Aug 12, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/d9d9\">d9d9</a>","created_at":"2012-08-12T15:51:36Z"},{"body":" <p>Well, that certainly would be a bug, then.

The bug occures irregardless of whether icons or bars ignore the GCD. What's happening is that every icon for an ability that consumes or generates rage goes invisible during the GCD. Turning up the alpha when failed makes them faintly visible again. Warrior abilities that don't interact with the ragebar function normally.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 14 2012 14:24:12 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1344972252\">Aug 14, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-08-14T13:31:19Z"},{"body":" <p>Fixed in r533.
