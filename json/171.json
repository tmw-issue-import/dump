{"issue":{"title":"[CF 171] More conditions! ","body":" <p><strong>If you have an idea for a new condition, please open a new ticket for it, rather than posting a comment on this ticket</strong></p>\r\n<h3>New conditions that I am considering:</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Unit cooldown (this one is a little maybe)\r\n</li><li>Internal cooldown (this one is a big <strong>MAYBE</strong>)\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>FOR HISTORICAL RECORD: I have decided not to implement these last 2. The way that internal cooldowns are tracked is far too advanced for the current framework for conditions, and Unit cooldowns would require an additional data entry field, but the condition editor is already way too crowded as it is.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/171\">#171</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/171.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-04-30T03:11:14Z","created_at":"2011-04-16T23:49:17Z","updated_at":"2011-04-30T03:11:14Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>How about threat as a condition?
