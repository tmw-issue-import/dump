I assume the former, as if the arenaX frame ceased to exist entirely I would assume the condition wouldn't fire at all, as it still requires A1/2/3 to be fetched and equated to a healing spec in the first place.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"10 23 2018 03:45:00 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1540284300\">Oct 23, 2018</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2018-10-23T08:41:02Z"}]}
