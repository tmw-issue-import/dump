{"issue":{"title":"[CF 463] Inline Aura Compatibility ","body":" <p><em>Cybeloras edit: No need to keep the defect ticket template in there for a feature request</em></p>\r\n<p>Currently, the \"Show timer text\" button in the options is unavailable unless you have OmniCC running.

Since TMW is not an action bar mod, and IA has no external API to support non-actionbar implementation, this cannot happen.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-03-14T02:11:27Z"}]}
