{"issue":{"title":"[CF 481] Change icon numbering direction ","body":" <p>I'm making a block of addons to track a lot of buffs/debuffs, and I want to sort them by duration, with the first icons showing up in the bottom left. No matter what combination of sorting low and high by shown and duration I use, I can't get icons to start appearing in the bottom left, only the top left and the bottom right. I'm guessing this is because of the way icons are numbered in groups, and I can't find a way to change that. Would it be possible to add some way to change the direction of icon numbering?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/pikapikatrap\">pikapikatrap</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/481\">#481</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/481.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-11T03:58:32Z","created_at":"2012-04-15T09:24:35Z","updated_at":"2012-05-11T03:58:32Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Not going to rule this out, but I can't make any promises either.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-04-15T18:00:05Z"},{"body":" <p>Added in r516</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-05-11T03:58:07Z"}]}
