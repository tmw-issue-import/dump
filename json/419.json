{"issue":{"title":"[CF 419] Additional triggers for animations ","body":" <p>Could you make it possible to trigger an animation based on another icon being shown? I'm trying to give my rotation icon an activation border when I should cast Heroic Strike aswell as the flashing animation when I should cast Inner Rage. However there aren't any obvious methods to accomplish this. I have tried creating additional metaicons with animations to override my main metaicon, but this is already causing quirky behaviour from the get-go, aswell as being incredibly messy and probably also not very efficient for the CPU to handle.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/419\">#419</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/419.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-02-09T02:09:02Z","created_at":"2012-01-10T16:00:06Z","updated_at":"2012-02-09T02:09:02Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Also, while playing around with animations, I noticed the color picker for the flash animation has 0% opacity at the top, where + is, and 100% opacity at the bottom, where - is.

One thing I can say for sure is this: metaicons will stop a running animation when the active subicon switches. Note: the animation is attached to the metaicon, not one of the subicons.</p>\r\n<p>Also, animations triggered by the \"icon show\"-event don't end when the icon is hidden. (presumably animations triggered by \"icon hide\" also don't end when the icon becomes shown.)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"02 2 2012 23:51:27 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1328248287\">Feb 2, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-02-03T05:28:32Z"},{"body":" <p>That is actually \"intended\". Because of the way that meta icons inherit settings, when a meta icon inherits an icon that is playing an animation, it is the same (code-wise) as the meta icon playing that animation.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that a meta icon will clear animations that originated on the meta icon when the icon being checked changes is an unforeseen consequence of this, though, and I will get it fixed tomorrow.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-02-03T05:51:38Z"},{"body":" <p>It should be working properly now.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-02-05T02:34:01Z"}]}
