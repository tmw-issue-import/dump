{"issue":{"title":"[CF 899] Alpha Flash with an opacity adjustment ","body":" <p>I have noticed that blizz's default animation for buffs/debuffs doesn't flash all the way to 0%, rather it goes to 60% (maybe) and I was wondering if a corresponding slider \"Icon: Alpha Flash\" animation would be appropriate in order to have the same effect. I poked around the settings but couldn't find a solution.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/mjlnr\">mjlnr</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/899\">#899</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/899.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-04-26T23:47:28Z","created_at":"2013-12-18T08:14:32Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T23:47:28Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Done in ge055094.
