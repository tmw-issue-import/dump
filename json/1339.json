{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1339] New .mp3 custom sounds not working ","body":" <p>#1: This is my FAVORITE ADDON of them ALL!!<br>#2: Expect donations for this amazing work and upkeep!<br><br>Now for my problem: I can't get custom sounds to work. I can get the custom mp3 files that I added years ago when I first discovered this addon to work.. but not any new ones that I've added now that I'm back into WoW.<br><br>1) Yes I restarted WoW (and even my computer) many times after adding them to the root WoW folder.<br>2) I've tried other folders and yes I am typing them correctly for the file path \"test.mp3\" for root -or- \"Interface/AddOns/TellMeWhen/Sounds/test.mp3\" etc..<br>3) Yes they are mp3 file extensions<br><br>I just don't get why I can get my sound files that I used years ago to work but not the ones I just added. I did a side by side comparison of the old and new mp3 files and everything is exactly the same (except for the different file names of course) and they are in exactly the same location.<br><br>Please Help? Because I absolutely LOVE this addon and being able to hear my own voice yell at me in the game is very satisfying.<br><br>~Storm</p><p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Create a new custom sound file, change the extension to be a \".mp3\" file<br>2. Please the new mp3 audio file in the root folder of WoW<br>3. Make a notification trigger for sound to play with using the custom sound file.<br>4. Click the little speaker icon to test the sound and you should end up hearing that it doesn't work.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p><p>I expect the new .mp3 sound file to work when I try to test it in the TMW addon just like my old sounds do that I had made and added to the same root folder years ago. Instead only the .mp3 files that I added 3 years ago are working while the new .mp3 files are not.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?</p><p>v 8.2.3</p><p>Do you have an error log of what happened?</p><p>No I don't think so. If one could be produced then I would gladly provide it.</p><p>Please provide any additional information below:</p><p>Attaching one of the new sound files that I am trying to get to work with this ticket. If I can include one of the old .mp3 files that ARE working then I will include that as well.</p><p>~Storm</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/t3chn0maha\">t3chn0maha</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1339\">#1339</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1339.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-11-26T20:31:36Z","created_at":"2016-11-06T03:49:48Z","updated_at":"2016-11-26T20:32:22Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/86/148/DarkSoul.mp3\" target=\"_blank\"> DarkSoul.mp3</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">DarkSoul.mp3</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the old mp3 files that IS working&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/t3chn0maha\">t3chn0maha</a>","created_at":"2016-11-06T03:49:48Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/86/149/test.mp3\" target=\"_blank\"> test.mp3</a><br> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">test.mp3</h4> <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a new mp3 file that is NOT working&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/t3chn0maha\">t3chn0maha</a>","created_at":"2016-11-06T03:49:48Z"},{"body":" <p>Already responded to this ticket on the old site, but data was lost in the migration.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 26 2016 14:32:22 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1480192342\">Nov 26, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-11-26T20:31:36Z"}]}
