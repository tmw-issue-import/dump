{"issue":{"title":"[CF 148] Only When Equipped - Bugged? ","body":" <p>Hello, I have a minor issue or am simply not grasping how this condition works - wonderful addon btw <span>:)</span></p>\r\n<ul><li>Attached a screenshot of the icon parameters I am using.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Basically I am trying to make a large button show only when I have rocket boots equipped. When they are equipped I want the icon to show regardless of whether they are usable (though at 80% visibility if so).</p>\r\n<p>However, the button just appears regardless of whether they are equipped or not (though the usable condition is operating correctly).</p>\r\n<p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
