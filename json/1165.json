{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1165] Reset Counter on Combat Finish ","body":" <p>Hi,</p><p>I was wondering if you could point me to a possible solution. I have the icon below. It's a rather straight forward Icon that track DBM or BigWigs for the Timer on Nether Banish during Archimonde fight. Everytime the timer drop below 10 sec the icon show and I am increase a counter by 1. Then I just do a modulo of that counter to check if it's group 1 or group 2 that should go inside and show it on the Icon. My issue is that I don't seem to be able to find a way to reset the Counter when the fight either End or we wipe. I am just not sure if there's an easy solution to make that counter reset after combat.</p><p>^1^T^SType^Sconditionicon ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SBIGWIGS_ENGAGED ^SName^SArchimonde ^t^N2^T ^SType^SBIGWIGS_TIMER ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SLevel^N10 ^SName^SNether~`Banish ^t^N3^T ^SType^SHEALTH ^SOperator^S&lt;= ^SUnit^Sboss~`1 ^SLevel^N40 ^t^Sn^N3 ^t^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCounter ^SCounterAmt^N0 ^SCounterOperation^S= ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SCounter^Snetherbanish ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOMBAT ^SLevel^N1 ^SName^SArchimonde ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^SSound ^SSound^SWarning ^SEvent^SOnShow ^t^N3^T ^SType^SCounter ^SEvent^SOnShow ^SCounter^Snetherbanish ^t^Sn^N3 ^t^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STextLayout^Sicon2 ^STexts^T ^N1^S[Counter(\"netherbanish\")~`%~`2~`=~`1~`?~`\"G1\"~`!~`\"G2\"] ^t^t^t^SCustomTex^S186952 ^SFakeHidden^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^N74003^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/InfernalAura\">InfernalAura</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1165\">#1165</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1165.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-05-19T03:45:21Z","created_at":"2015-09-30T00:16:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T03:45:21Z","labels":["resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>It looks like the handler that you have on there already is doing the trick - at least it is for me when I test it myself.

Or, if you want to be sure that the icon will still function when you're dead, change the reset notification condition to check that Archimonde isn't engaged.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"10 3 2015 16:34:03 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1443908043\">Oct 3, 2015</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2015-10-03T18:29:02Z"},{"body":" <p>Thank You !
