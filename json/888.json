{"issue":{"title":"[CF 888] Groups of objects ","body":" <p>Hey. I wonder if there is any chance you will add an ability to make groups of objects. For example i make the group \"123\"so i can paste there all nicknames i need and edit this list.&nbsp; And then i could just choose \"123\" as object in all icons (or even conditions may be) instead of adding new name in each one all the time. That would be nice.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Ckotuna\">Ckotuna</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/888\">#888</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/888.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-11-16T05:09:08Z","created_at":"2013-11-13T15:15:49Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T14:38:18Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I can't see a feature like this being used to enough to justify adding it into TellMeWhen.

Two examples are provided. Press \"Accept\" and reload your UI after changing the groups for changes to take effect. To use, simply put @SHAMANS or @OTHERPEOPLE (or whatever you want to name your groups) in your units to watch for any icon.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 17 2013 00:41:36 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1384670496\">Nov 17, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-11-16T05:08:45Z"}]}
