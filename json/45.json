Installed latest release version from curse, using curse addon manager (later, duplicated the same steps and error result with latest beta released Nov 18). Using Dominos action bars, ouf framework and ouf_lumen module.<br>2. Entered game. (This is a fresh install, have not used this addon before today.)</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</p><p>Expected to unlock Group 1 and customise spells. Instead got LUA error pasted above. Nothing appears on-screen. Slash command triggers same error.<br>Entered config through Blizzard interface menu, was able to uncheck lock, but still no icon boxes appear onscreen and same LUA error is again triggered. Reset All function doesn't help.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?<br>TMW 2.0.0 b8</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Froidre\">Froidre</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/45\">#45</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/45.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-11-19T03:04:54Z","created_at":"2010-11-18T16:17:36Z","updated_at":"2010-11-19T03:04:54Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I'm seeing the same error. In my case, I had deleted my saved variables file because I was seeing a lot of other errors from TellMeWhen, probably because I had a corrupted set somehow.</p>\r\n<p>The problem seems to be that when TMW creates an initial set of saved variables, it misses out a field which is required for support of LibButtonFacade. It looks like upgrading from a previous version takes care of this, it's just for initial installs or (in my case) fresh defaults that are a problem.</p>\r\n<p>One workround might be to just disable or uninstall ButtonFacade; I haven't tried that, though. The workround I'm trying myself is to add the following as line 91 of the main TellMeWhen.lua:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n   \tLBF\t= {},\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>Making something like this:</p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n\tPoint\t = {},\r\n\tLBF\t= {},\r\n   };\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div><p>If you now remove TellMeWhen's saved variable file for your character and restart WoW, it will create new defaults that are OK if you're running ButtonFacade. Obviously that wouldn't be something you'd want to do if you had already set up some groups...</p>\r\n<p>I don't know if this is all that's required to fix this issue, but it lets me log in without the error at least.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/alerre\">alerre</a>","created_at":"2010-11-18T18:17:35Z"},{"body":" <p>Sorry, When I added button facade settings per group I forgot to add a blank entry to the defaults.
