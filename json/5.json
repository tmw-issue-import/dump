{"issue":{"title":"[CF 5] Dual spec cooldowns ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Any class with multiple spec-specific cooldowns based on talents.</p><p>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?<br>When switching specs the cooldowns aren't \"refreshed\", instead I can only begin to see for example PI cooldown after I've used it once in that spec, or after cycling /tellmewhen to make it manually pick up the spec change.</p><p>What version of the product are you using?<br>1.1.2</p><p>Please provide any additional information below.<br>Whilst simply implementing a automated \"refresh\" function would probably do the trick, I'd love to see full out dualspec support instead with the ability to associate a given spec to a given set of timers. As is you end up displaying useless information(or rather in my case, blank boxes with questionmarks) where the other specs cooldowns would be.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/SunTzu\">SunTzu</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/5\">#5</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/5.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2010-03-13T19:51:26Z","created_at":"2009-09-14T13:47:11Z","updated_at":"2010-03-13T19:52:23Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Dual Spec is now part of the addon, but i verified this is still a problem on my DK.
