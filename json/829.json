There is some issue with the texture Interface\\Buttons\\UI-SquareButton-Disabled.tga (which baffles me because TMW does not use that texture anywhere). That is the only thing that all these errors have in common - some of them are caused when TellMeWhen is in the process of calling a Blizzard API function (so far I have seen it happen with GetSpellInfo, GetItemInfo, and GetGlyphInfo), but some others are happening when TMW is not running any code at all.</p>\r\n<p>I guess we will just have to wait it out until Blizzard fixes things. I can load up the PTR without issue after enduring about 5 of these crashes. That is a sure sign that this is something on Blizzard's end of things (in the client code) and not TMW. Addons should never, under any circumstance, be able to completely crash the game. Any time that they do is a flaw in Blizzard's code.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for reporting this. Make sure to also report the error to Blizzard when the dialog pops up.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"06 24 2013 04:07:36 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1372064856\">Jun 24, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-06-24T06:48:21Z"},{"body":" <p>Yeah of course. I love this addon and PTR testing every boss on 10/25 and N/H without TellMeWhen is going to make me want to cut myself.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully Blizzard will hear about this somehow and fix it in a future (hopefully near future) PTR build.</p>\r\n<p>E: Although I'm unsure what it matters, but with TMW loaded, it doesn't *always* crash me upon reload.

This is just totally baffling me. <del>Maybe I can narrow it down to something other than the entire addon because it seems to be OK when I log in to a character that uses a blank profile (while my hunter's profile and some other profiles crash pretty (although not completely) consistently).</del></p>\r\n<p>Scratch that. After testing out a bunch of different profiles, it does seem to be completely random.</p>\r\n<p>So, now we have:</p>\r\n<ul><li>GetSpellBookItemName\r\n</li><li>GetSpellInfo\r\n</li><li>GetItemInfo\r\n</li><li>GetGlyphInfo\r\n</li><li>GetTalentInfo\r\n</li><li>... and also sometimes no function call at all\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>that are causing this. This is seriously irritating the hell out of me. Every single one of them has the same error: Async streaming failed for Interface\\Buttons\\UI-SquareButton-Disabled.tga. Errorstack: (null)</p>\r\n<p>And TellMeWhen is the only addon I have found that is triggering this problem (even though TellMeWhen does not use this texture in any way - this texture doesn't even exist as far as I am aware of, although I'm probably wrong. I don't see it in my BlizzardInterfaceArt dump and can't find anything when I Google it.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"06 26 2013 14:17:24 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1372274244\">Jun 26, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-06-26T09:29:54Z"},{"body":" <p>Seems to be fixed in build 17124</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-06-27T23:44:57Z"}]}
