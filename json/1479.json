{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1479] Monkspell \"Tiger Palm\" creating a bug in the \"counter-notification\" - condition on german client. ","body":" <p>Hi first,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>i would like to report a problem/bug with TMW in version 8.4.3. Ive made an icon that should be only shown once during a fight. For this i have created the main icon with my conditions in it and set two notification handlers. For my notifications i have both used the \"counter\" notification, set as \"on condition set passing\". The condition to check in one of the counter is set as \"last ability used\" with my chosen spell to track. And here starts the problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If i start the fight (and the last spell before ive entered this fight was not tiger palm) and i use any monk dmgspell on the dummy except tiger palm the icon is still shown. But if i use the spell tiger palm the icon disappears. In the counter-condition, the last ability to track is not!! set as tiger palm but somehow it seems that tiger palm apply as any spell in this condition of the counter-notification.</p>\r\n<p>If I leave the combat and the last spell that I used was tiger palm, wait till Im out of combat and start the combat again with tiger palm as the first spell,the icon is still shown. But if i use then another spell except tiger palm in this fight the icon will disappear.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So my point being is, that the \"last ability used\"-condition in the counter-notification will be tracked by tiger palm,no matter which spell you write in \"last ability used\". I have noticed this problem on the german client (maybe other languages as well, i didnt test it) while this problem isnt happening with the english client.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I hope that you can understand what i mean, because my english is not the best and find a fix for it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best regards.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Edit:My icon contains a \"last ability used\"-condition with tiger palm in it besides the other three conditions in the icon. It can/should be removed for testing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here is the string for my icon with the german client:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SType^Scooldown ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOUNTER ^SName^Swds ^t^N2^T ^SType^SCOMBAT ^t^N3^T ^SType^SLASTCAST ^SName^STigerklaue ^t^N4^T ^SType^SDEBUFFSTACKS ^SChecked^B ^SUnit^Starget ^SName^SBer&uuml;hrung~`des~`Todes ^t^Sn^N4 ^t^SName^SBer&uuml;hrung~`des~`Todes ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SPassingCndt^B ^SType^SCounter ^SCndtJustPassed^B ^SOnlyShown^B ^SCounter^Swds ^SValue^N1 ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLASTCAST ^SName^SBer&uuml;hrung~`des~`Todes ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^SCounter ^SCounterAmt^N0 ^SCounter^Swds ^SCounterOperation^S= ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOMBAT ^SLevel^N1 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^SAlpha^N0 ^t^N4^T ^SAlpha^N0 ^t^t^SRangeCheck^B ^SEnabled^B ^SManaCheck^B ^t^N84305^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And here is the string for my icon with the english client:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>^1^T^SType^Scooldown ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOUNTER ^SName^Swds ^t^N2^T ^SType^SCOMBAT ^t^N3^T ^SType^SLASTCAST ^SName^STiger~`Palm ^t^N4^T ^SType^SDEBUFFSTACKS ^SChecked^B ^SUnit^Starget ^SName^STouch~`of~`Death ^t^Sn^N4 ^t^SName^STouch~`of~`Death ^SEvents^T ^N1^T ^SPassingCndt^B ^SType^SCounter ^SCndtJustPassed^B ^SOnlyShown^B ^SValue^N1 ^SCounter^Swds ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SLASTCAST ^SName^STouch~`of~`Death ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SType^SCounter ^SCounter^Swds ^SCounterAmt^N0 ^SCounterOperation^S= ^SEvent^SOnCondition ^SOnConditionConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCOMBAT ^SLevel^N1 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^Sn^N2 ^t^SManaCheck^B ^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N3^T ^SAlpha^N0 ^t^N4^T ^SAlpha^N0 ^t^t^SRangeCheck^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^N84305^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1479\">#1479</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1479.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-03-27T23:21:41Z","created_at":"2018-03-26T22:43:39Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T23:22:22Z","labels":["defect"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Its solved,the problem was that i didnt know how the counter notification handler works ;(</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2018-03-27T23:22:22Z"}]}
