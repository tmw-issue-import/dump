{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1567] Option to inherit visibility state of frame icon is anchored to ","body":" <p>This is like the one thing from WeakAuras I actually like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>WeakAuras has an option that is defaulted on which inherits the visibility state of the frame that a specific icon/group is anchored to. For example, if I anchor a group to my action bar, if my action bar hides, so will the anchored group. Good for not having to set up a bunch of extraneous visibility conditions on multiple groups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JqKtdon.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://i.imgur.com/JqKtdon.jpg</a> example picture of the option in WA</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1567\">#1567</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1567.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-25T01:04:24Z","created_at":"2018-08-31T06:11:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T01:04:24Z","labels":["enhancement"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>You can use \"miscellaneous &gt; icon is shown\" condition to track this.

Not that hard to do, but a bit superfluous, hence the suggestion for the new option. Or depending on the group itself, I can keep the icon conditions specific to itself, and use the group conditions for all the visibility related stuff.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 26 2018 03:38:47 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1537951127\">Sep 26, 2018</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2018-09-26T08:34:35Z"},{"body":" <p>Probably won't be adding this.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-12-25T01:04:24Z"}]}
