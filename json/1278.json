{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1278] Reverse bar direction ","body":" <p>Excuse me if I have just missed something but I have been scouring the options menu and I can't seem to see any way of reversing the bar directions for my icons. I have been able to mirror everything (the icon position, the text positioning etc) other than the way in which the bar moves. I see the 'fill bar up' option but what I am looking for is an option to simply have the bar decay from left to right, opposite to the default way it decays.</p><p>I believe this would be a simple addition if it's not already implemented. If it's already implemented would you be able to point me in the right direction? Thanks.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/sk3ng\">sk3ng</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1278\">#1278</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1278.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-09-18T22:21:42Z","created_at":"2016-08-17T17:17:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-18T22:21:42Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>For instance, Could you make it so the bar direction is affected by the 'flip icon' option?
