{"issue":{"title":"[CF 974] [Beta] A Few Bugs ","body":" <p>1) Sometimes the checkboxes will all stack on top of each other. Closing and reopening the config window will make it fix itself, though.<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anzI8/26a62b563a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anzI8/26a62b563a.jpg</a></p><p>2) The 'hand' of the timer swing is yellow and more pronounced<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anzK9/88c327005c.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anzK9/88c327005c.jpg</a> beta<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anzPN/ffd1444901.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anzPN/ffd1444901.jpg</a> live<br>(Ignore the empty timer swing on the left, that icon is manually set to blank)</p><p>3) In WOD, there are 3 raid difficulties/sizes. LFR (25 players), normal and heroic (which are flexible for 10-25 players). and mythic (20 players). Might want to rearrange some of the categories.<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anzT5/79bdbb7328.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anzT5/79bdbb7328.jpg</a><br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anzZm/6e79156f10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anzZm/6e79156f10.jpg</a></p><p>4) Not so much a bug, but it may be. Trying to make a working spell cooldown aura for Gladiator Stance's \"Shield Charge\" ability. For some reason the aura won't show up as it should. When I try to track a similar ability (charge with the Double Time talent), it tracks perfectly fine, so it has to be something with this ability specifically (and as such might be on Blizzard's end). I've tried tracking by naming it Shield Charge, Shield Block (the ability shield charge replaces by spec'ing into glad stance), and by setting the exact spell ID.<br><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/bQYhynRS\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/bQYhynRS</a></p><p>E: I got the aura to work by making the icon the exact spell ID of Shield Block (2565). Unsure if this is an error with TMW requiring the exact ID of the ability that was replaced for a spell cooldown of this type, or something buggy on Blizzard's end.</p><p>5) Certain auras in my setup repeatedly delete themself upon a relog.<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anApn/8463a00e9b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anApn/8463a00e9b.jpg</a> (check the two Colossus Smash auras in the top left group)<br><a href=\"http://puu.sh/anAqN/61bdbc5108.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://puu.sh/anAqN/61bdbc5108.jpg</a> (after relog, both auras are now gone)</p><p><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/dkSPg0Lu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/dkSPg0Lu</a> for my setup if you want to test it. Won't have global auras (unless you changed that they are exported too, now) so if you want I can un-global them and reupload the export.</p><p>6) The game will lag/freeze when typing in the 'Choose spell(s) to check' and 'Custom Texture' boxes. There're also some green boxes for the Layout Settings/Copy buttons and the resize handle, but I'm sure you know that.</p><p>7) Not a bug but more of a suggestion, in the short time using WeakAuras before you had pushed a beta version, they have an option for each aura for a 'zoom', which is nice as it allows you to zoom in past the border textures, making the icon look much cleaner. Might be a nice feature to add that can be put on an icon/group/global level for people who want a cleaner look w/o using something like Masque.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/974\">#974</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/974.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2014-07-24T02:13:53Z","created_at":"2014-07-23T11:38:45Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T02:13:53Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p><a href=\"http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/repositories/warlords/files/57-7-0-2-34-ga4b515c/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/repositories/warlords/files/57-7-0-2-34-ga4b515c/</a></p>\r\n<p>Using that version, I forgot to add.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a>","created_at":"2014-07-23T12:59:10Z"},{"body":" <p>2) Yeah, I need to bring back the option to toggle that.
