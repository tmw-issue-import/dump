{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1102] How to track school lockout duration of Kick (rogue)? ","body":" <p>Hey there! :)</p><p>I'm enjoying exploring TellMeWhen in terms of tracking buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns. But, I've hit a snag and for the life of me, I can't figure out how to do it, and after searching online, I don't see anyone else who's done it. I also checked the forums but didn't find anything there so... I must impose upon you for a solution, if indeed it's even possible.</p><p>I play a rogue.</p><p>In TellMeWhen, I've set up 2 groups. The group on the left shows my self-buffs (slice-and-dice, recuperate, etc.), and my cooldowns (gouge, kick, kidney shot, evasion, etc.).</p><p>The group on the right shows debuffs that I've cast upon my target. It's this side where I'm having trouble with my \"Kick\" ability. The tooltip reads as follows:</p><p>\"A quick kick that interrupts spellcasting and prevents any spell in that school from being cast for 5 seconds\"</p><p>Kick has a 15-second cooldown and I've got that working in the left group (my buffs &amp; cd's) as follows:</p><p>^1^T^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Scooldown ^SAlpha^N0.66 ^SShowTimerText^B ^SName^S1766 ^SUnAlpha^N0.33 ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SEnabled^B ^SShowCBar^B ^t^N72603^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>Works like a charm. I'm using the timer bar of TMW, and the text countdown that OmniCC affords, and I love the combination of the two.</p><p>On the right side, what I want to track is the 5-second spell-school lockout. I've tried shift-clicking \"Kick\" from the spell book but that doesn't show me a duration. I tried more generally typing the word \"Kick\" into the spell box so as to catch any incarnation of it, but that doesn't work, either. I even enabled the debuffs from WoW's default UI to see if I could catch what, exactly, the debuff for that 5-second lockout might be called, but no luck (I was inspired to do this after I had a similar problem tracking Gouge's incapacitate duration. I eventually stumbled upon \"Incapacitate,\" which may be triggered by roughly 20 different class abilities; So \"incapacitate\" works for Gouge but... nothing seems to work for Kick. Here's the string I currently have for that right-side group:</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^Starget ^SType^Sbuff ^SAlpha^N0.66 ^SName^Skick ^SShowTimerText^B ^SUnAlpha^N0.33 ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SEnabled^B ^t^N72603^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>I'm beginning to think that if no debuff icon occurs in WoW's default UI, then maybe it's not something that an addon can track. In a perfect world, I'd also add a text display that named the school that got locked-out but, for now, I'd settle for the 5-second lock-out duration if it's possible.</p><p>If it's at all helpful, here are the left-group and right-group strings that I'm using for Gouge, which show the \"incapacitate\" way that i got them to work for that spell:</p><p>LEFT-group, Gouge, spell cooldown:</p><p>^1^T^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Scooldown ^SAlpha^N0.66 ^SShowTimerText^B ^SName^S1776 ^SShowPBar^B ^SUnAlpha^N0.33 ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SManaCheck^B ^SShowCBar^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^N72603^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>RIGHT-group, Incapacitate (Gouge, etc.), debuff:</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SType^Sbuff ^SAlpha^N0.66 ^SName^SIncapacitated ^SShowTimerText^B ^SUnAlpha^N0.33 ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SUnit^Starget ^SOnlyMine^B ^SEnabled^B ^t^N72603^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>Additionally, I've uploaded 2 screen shots. One of Gouge working on both groups, and one of Kick showing the right-group icon failing to register any indication of debuff and/or duration.</p><p>Thanks very much for any help you might provide, and even if it turns out not to be possible for this particular debuff duration, thanks again for an already awesome addon!<br>###<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.</p><p>IMPORTANT: If your issue is only occurring with a specific icon, include an export string of the icon in this ticket. Similarly, if the issue involves an entire group or an entire profile, include the entire export string of the group or profile.</p><p>To get an export string, open the icon editor, and click button labeled \"Import/Export/Backup\".

What happens instead?</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
