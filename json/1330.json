{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1330] Show dot strength icon not working with german client ","body":" <p>Hi and sry for bothering again.</p><p>I was creating an icon which should be shown when my dot is under a certain value. Like you told me i should use \"Debuff - Tooltip Number #1\" as condition. I did it but it still wont work and i was wondering about why yours is working while mine is not. So is switched my language from german to english and itÂ´s working as intended.<br>With the english client it can read the value set in \"Debuff - Tooltip Number #1\" correctly( it seems also to count the amount of combo points i was using) and disappears if the value is exceeded. If i am using my german client it seems only to count the amount of combo points i was using and thats it but it cant read the value of the strength of the dot. Maybe its working with other languages as well as my german client.</p><p>I dont know it this kind is work as intended and/or not fixable with other language based clients. I was also testing it on Rogue and Moonkin and it works like described above.</p><p>These are the icons with i was testing it. I named them \"ENG\"&nbsp; for english and \"GER\" for german.Also \"Zerfetzen\" is the german word for \"Rip\".</p><p>ENG:</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^Starget ^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SDEBUFFTOOLTIPSCAN1 ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N5000 ^SName^SRip ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SShowTTText^B ^SName^SRip ^SEnabled^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STexts^T ^N1^SENG ^t^t^t^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N2^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N82008^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>GER:</p><p>^1^T^SBuffOrDebuff^SHARMFUL ^SUnit^Starget ^SOnlyMine^B ^SType^Sbuff ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SDEBUFFTOOLTIPSCAN1 ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SUnit^Starget ^SLevel^N5000 ^SName^SZerfetzen ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^SShowTTText^B ^SName^SZerfetzen ^SEnabled^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STexts^T ^N1^SGER ^t^t^t^SStates^T ^N1^T ^t^N2^T ^SAlpha^N1 ^t^N3^T ^t^N4^T ^t^t^t^N82008^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>I also did some screenshots of it and hope that you get what i mean cause my english is not the best.<br>The number 1 and 3 on the icons in the screenshot are the combo points i was spending for this spell at the time.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1330\">#1330</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1330.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-29T00:39:19Z","created_at":"2016-10-28T15:01:04Z","updated_at":"2016-10-29T00:39:19Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/107/ENG2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> ENG2.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/107/ENG2.jpg\" title=\"ENG2.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/107/126/126/ENG2.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">ENG2.jpg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-10-28T15:01:04Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/108/ENG1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> ENG1.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/108/ENG1.jpg\" title=\"ENG1.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/108/126/126/ENG1.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">ENG1.jpg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-10-28T15:01:04Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/111/Ger2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> Ger2.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/111/Ger2.jpg\" title=\"Ger2.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/111/126/126/Ger2.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">Ger2.jpg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-10-28T15:01:04Z"},{"body":"<strong>Attachment Added:</strong><a href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/112/Ger1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> Ger1.jpg</a><br> <a class=\"e-avatar128 lightbox\" href=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/76/112/Ger1.jpg\" title=\"Ger1.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/76/112/126/126/Ger1.jpg\"> </a> <div class=\"attachment-desc\"> <h4 class=\"attachment-title\">Ger1.jpg</h4> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Mindfork\">Mindfork</a>","created_at":"2016-10-28T15:01:04Z"},{"body":" <p>Should be working in g2cd8bb9: <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/files/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/files/</a></p>\r\n<p>You'll want to use #2 instead of #1 for the German client, since the damage is the second number in the tooltip instead of the first like it is for English.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"10 28 2016 19:39:11 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1477701551\">Oct 28, 2016</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-10-29T00:38:25Z"}]}
