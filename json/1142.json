{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1142] Group Conditions with Icon is Shown not always evaluating properly ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>\r\n1. On a WW monk, Initiate Combat, generate some Chi<br>\r\n2. Cast Tiger Palm for Tiger Power buff<br>\r\n3. Wait and watch the time on the buff</p>\r\n<p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>\r\nWhen the buff has &lt; 10s remaining, the icon in Group 2 should show (as the group condition of Group 1 is failed and is hidden). Instead, the icon in Group 2 never shows - not even in the 5-10s remaining window of the buff one would expect it to.</p>\r\n<p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using? (\"The latest\" is not a version)<br>\r\n7.4.0 r5 (gc0457b4)</p>\r\n<p>Please provide any additional information below (including any export strings if applicable; see above.)<br>\r\nOddly, changing the group condition to other things sometimes works but sometimes doesn't - I couldn't find a predictable pattern for the behavior. Note that this is a proof of concept for the bug - I do not need \"support\" in achieving a suitable work-around. </p>\r\n<div><div><div>\n\n```\n^1^T^SNumGroups^N2 ^SGroups^T ^N1^T ^SPoint^T ^Sy^N-0.99993896484375 ^Sx^F-8127577067618304 ^f-46^t ^STree2^b ^SGUID^STMW:group:1Lhlm5dkB0rT ^STree1^b ^SIcons^T ^N1^T ^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Scooldown ^SName^STiger~`Palm ^SClockGCD^B ^SGUID^STMW:icon:1Lhlm5dnsfkb ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STexts^T ^N1^S&lt;5 ^t^t^t^SEnabled^B ^t^t^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SLevel^N5 ^SName^STiger~`Power ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N2^T ^SPoint^T ^Sy^N-35.000244140625 ^Sx^F-8162770029641728 ^f-46^t ^STree2^b ^SGUID^STMW:group:1LhlmlfhdpWd ^STree1^b ^SIcons^T ^N1^T ^SShowTimer^B ^SType^Scooldown ^SName^STiger~`Palm ^SClockGCD^B ^SSettingsPerView^T ^Sicon^T ^STexts^T ^N1^S&lt;10 ^t^t^t^SEnabled^B ^SConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SBUFFDUR ^SChecked^B ^SOperator^S&lt; ^SLevel^N10 ^SName^STiger~`Power ^t^N2^T ^SType^SICON ^SLevel^N1 ^SIcon^STMW:icon:1Lhlm5dnsfkb ^t^Sn^N2 ^t^t^t^t^t^SVersion^N74002 ^t^N74002^S~`~| ^Sprofile^STEST ^^\r\n\n```\n</div></div>\r\n</div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/canofbutter\">canofbutter</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1142\">#1142</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1142.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T23:35:49Z","created_at":"2015-07-22T02:48:33Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T23:35:49Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>The description of the Icon Shown condition clearly states that the group of the icon being checked must be shown in order for the condition to work.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-05-20T23:35:41Z"}]}
