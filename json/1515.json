{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1515] Diminishing Returns Reset Delay ","body":" <p>Hi guys:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've been using this addon and sincerally is really great. But i have a suggestion or maybe i dont know how to do this ... for example, in my case those 18 or 19 seconds of delay before the DR count resets are not enough (im an assas rogue) because when the addon tells me that i can use my next cc withouth DR its false, i was still being affected by DR. So, i would like to try with 20 or 21 seconds of reset delay because i feel, in my case, is the correct time. If in the current addon version its not possible to do this modification, i would appreciate so much if you can implement this feature(the possibility of modifying DR reset delay) in a next update :).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for all!!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Greetings.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/carloseds\">carloseds</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1515\">#1515</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1515.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-07-21T20:23:54Z","created_at":"2018-07-20T04:17:05Z","updated_at":"2018-07-21T20:23:54Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Blizzard officially says its 18, but you're right - its very rare that it actually finishes at 18.
