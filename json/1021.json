{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1021] Player Unit Condition Spell In Range ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>1. Import the string and log into a warrior character that has Commanding Shout<br>2. Remove all Stamina Buffs from your character and do not be in a group<br>3. Note that the icon does not appear as is expected.</p><p>What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?<br>This icon is set to look at raid 1-40; party 1-4; player.&nbsp; If a BonusStamina buff is missing, the unit in question is a player and in range of Commanding Shout, and I can cast Commanding Shout and I am a warrior, then appear.</p><p>Instead the icon does not appear.&nbsp; Changing the Unit condition of \"Is in range\" to \"is not in range\" will cause the icon to appear.&nbsp; It would seem that the unit condition of spell in range isn't behaving correctly for the player unit (at least for commanding shout).&nbsp; This is the same symptom for Battleshout.</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
