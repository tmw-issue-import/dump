{"issue":{"title":"[CF 464] Glyph Conditions ","body":" <p><em>Cybeloras edit: This is a feature request, not a defect.</em></p>\r\n<p>I looked in the conditions section of the options to see if I could set a condition based on the glyphs I had, but I noticed there was no option to check this. It would be useful for cases like Death and Decay, where the glyph increases the duration of it by 5 seconds.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/yesitisi\">yesitisi</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/464\">#464</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/464.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-05-08T23:52:48Z","created_at":"2012-03-14T01:17:20Z","updated_at":"2012-05-08T23:52:48Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[]}
