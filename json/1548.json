{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1548] Getting spell cost in lua comparison? ","body":" <p>Sorry if this isn't the right place to put this, the lack of forums now sucks :s</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Looking through \\TellMeWhen\\Components\\Core\\Conditions\\Categories\\spells.lua for a way to get spell cost, I'm not sure if its still possible to do this somehow in a lua conditional?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm trying to work out whether the cost of two spells combined is greater than current fury cost, when both spells have a potentially variable cost. In this specific case only one has a variable cost but it would be useful to be able to do both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(GetSpellPowerCost(\"Chaos Strike\")) + (GetSpellPowerCost(\"Blade Dance\")) &lt;= UnitPower(\"player\")</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I tried GetSpellPowerCost and GetSpellCost but neither seem to work. UnitPower(\"player\") does work, so I'm assuming that I'm misunderstanding the cost aspect or that it's not possible anymore?</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/user_976011\">user_976011</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1548\">#1548</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1548.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-08-15T04:22:34Z","created_at":"2018-08-14T12:47:41Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T04:22:34Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>TMW.GetSpellCost is the function you're looking for.
