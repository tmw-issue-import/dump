Multiple people who were having the same issue reported that the fix implemented in version 4.5.1 solved the problem.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>I have some additional information, after I upgrade to version 4.5.1(r181+), it only has crashed once ( i remeber i was change the group row / columns and click Okay). Before upgrade to r181, open the icon editor change everything and click okay will crash (not only for group setting).</p>\r\n<p>I am sure r181+ was fixed everything except the <strong>group setting</strong>. </p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/lsjyzjl\">lsjyzjl</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/277\">#277</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/277.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2011-08-16T02:04:38Z","created_at":"2011-08-15T12:14:54Z","updated_at":"2011-08-16T02:04:38Z","labels":["defect"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>I suppose this speaks for itself:</p>\r\n<h3>v4.5.3</h3>\r\n<ul><li>Bug Fixes:\r\n<ul><li>I accidentally commented out the fix for the error 132 crash.
