{"issue":{"title":"[CF 532] ALERT: TellMeWhen completely busted on live ","body":" <p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZZ4dD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/ZZ4dD.jpg</a></p><p>To note: There was a strange message in chat, you can still read it in the screenshot (though I get the same message with a different code on beta too). Also entering config mode does nothing. Happened as soon as I restarted WoW after installing r533. Went back to r532 and things are fine again. Beta is working fine too.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/532\">#532</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/532.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-08-15T21:55:38Z","created_at":"2012-08-15T14:50:57Z","updated_at":"2012-08-15T21:55:38Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Perhaps you should make separate beta builds?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a>","created_at":"2012-08-15T14:58:26Z"},{"body":" <p>Too hard to manage when the main addon is also pushing major changes.

The data needed isn't available till wayyyyy to late in the login process on live. It it available earlier in beta, which is why it works there. So, TMW was being initialized before these defaults were set, which basically disabled every group for every talent tree.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"08 15 2012 16:50:15 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1345067415\">Aug 15, 2012</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-15T21:50:15Z"},{"body":" <p>The message in chat was just some debugging output that I forgot to delete.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-08-15T21:52:49Z"}]}
