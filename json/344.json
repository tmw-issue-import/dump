Have you tried deleting TellMeWhen and TellMeWhen_Options from your Interface/Addons folder and reinstalling the addon?</p>\r\n<p>Your saved variables are not the issue here. The issue is that the core of TMW (TellMeWhen/TellMeWhen.lua) is not loading for some reason. TellMeWhen.xml is loading just fine, though. Have you installed a no-lib version and you are missing certain libraries? A missing library would certainly cause errors in the loading process.</p>\r\n<p>What I would recommend you do next (if reinstalling does not work) is to install BugGrabber and BugSack (both are required and both can be found on Curse.com). These addons will catch every single error that occurs in TellMeWhen's loading process (I am 99.99% sure there is another error that is occurring before the one you posted that is the cause of the problem.) When you load WoW, click on BugSack's minimap icon, and post each error that has been caught. Click the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons to scroll through all the errors.</p>\r\n<p>Sorry for all the trouble this has caused you, and thank you for working with me to get this resolved.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"11 21 2011 17:17:08 (CST) (UTC-6:00)\" data-epoch=\"1321917428\">Nov 21, 2011</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2011-11-21T23:16:16Z"},{"body":" <p>Thank you so much for helping me troubleshoot. When I noticed TMW did not load the first time, all I did was uninstall/reinstall via the Curse client. After that failed to fix the problem, I manually deleted the files from my Interface&gt;Addons folder + all the .lua files in my account folder.</p>\r\n<p>I did absolutely NOTHING that I can think of that would have changed the state of the addon. I just logged on one day and it didn't load. I had no installed or uninstalled anything prior to that (except maybe - I can't remember - maybe I updated other addons via the Curse client?).</p>\r\n<p>I just uninstalled/reinstalled TMW as well as BugGrabber and BugSack.
