I have been using TMW on my hunter for over 2 years and have never had a problem. Have you tried disabling all other addons? It could be an addon conflicting with the cooldown frames. Let me know if you find any that may be causing the problem. Deathknight GCD was definitely checking a spell that isn't always on the GCD. Hunter GCD checks serpent sting, and the only way that it could bug is to have a revive pet cast interupted, causing your nature school to be locked out.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2010-11-30T00:32:03Z"},{"body":" <p>Sorry about that, didn't see the new option that was added in 2.0.1 to ignore the GCD.
