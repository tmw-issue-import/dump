The animation doesn't start until the timer on the icon finishes. The timer doesn't finish unless its already been running. When you first log in or leave TMW's configuration, the timer hasn't been running, so it doesn't trigger. While condition set passing triggers would be a much better solution for what you're doing, which leads me to your second one...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second one was a timing issue with a performance optimization in TMW related to checking the GCD. Not sure how this never got noticed until now, because this certainly has been broken for many years. Will be fixed in the next alpha.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-10-22T01:41:30Z"},{"body":" <p>Thank you, im glad to hear this.
