{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1310] How to set\\change parent of a group? ","body":" <p>1) choose\\create any group so that the parent is default (ParentUI)<br>2) try to change its parent to some other group and click OK - it will still ParenUI</p><p>I am new to TMW, so maybe it's a rather dumb question. I have imported some profile for my class. All icons are locked to each other and can be dragged as a whole - except one. I tried to set the parent of that icon to the \"Group Anchor\", so it will be locked too, but it just doesn't change. I tried to copy the parent field from locked groups, but nothing worked.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/NoobLock2\">NoobLock2</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1310\">#1310</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1310.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-10-09T19:10:01Z","created_at":"2016-10-03T08:03:35Z","updated_at":"2016-10-09T19:10:01Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Right-click-and-drag an icon in the group that you want to change the anchor of to the group you want to anchor it to, and choose the appropriate option.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-10-07T02:16:34Z"}]}
