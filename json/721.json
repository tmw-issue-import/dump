When 9 groups do this at once, combined with a slow CPU and/or GPU, it can take too long and Blizzard stops the execution through their new throttling system.</p>\r\n<p>I will look into the issue more in the coming days and see if I can figure out how to fix it using the idea that popped into my mind.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-12-03T15:58:30Z"}]}
