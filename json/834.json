{"issue":{"title":"[CF 834] 'Animation' Events Don't Update ","body":" <p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/7H0Hf#0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/a/7H0Hf#0</a></p><p>When the condition comes to pass, the animation will go through. But when the condition reverts to a state upon which it fails, the animation does it go away, and will stay up for as long as the buff (stacking buff) continually rolls. For something like raging blow, which can hold 2 stacks, and I want to have an animation when it reaches max stack, to make sure I don't accidentally waste one, it's kind of annoying for this to happen. Is this just a technical limitation of the addon, or something? Or an error.</p><p>On another note, I tried making a two-part meta icon, one with tracking the buff, and another a combat event that tracks the buff based on the buff refreshing, and I couldn't really get that working at all. I dunno if the 'Aura Refreshed' event is having issues, or I was just setting up the addon incorrectly (pictured below)</p><p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/YxLPR#0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/a/YxLPR#0</a></p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Freeebo\">Freeebo</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/834\">#834</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/834.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2013-07-04T20:50:53Z","created_at":"2013-07-02T10:44:50Z","updated_at":"2013-07-04T20:50:53Z","labels":["defect","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>For the first issue, this is working as intended. You have an animation set to play indefinitely once the condition passes (which happens when the buff reaches two stacks). You need a Stop Animations animation on the icon as well if you want the animation to stop playing at some point.</p>\r\n<p>The Raging Blow buff does not ever fire the aura refreshed event (I think this is true for all stacking auras, although I could be wrong). It only fires aura applied, aura stack applied, aura stack removed, and aura removed. If it is refreshed at two stacks, no combat events are fired.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"07 3 2013 19:26:47 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1372897607\">Jul 3, 2013</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2013-07-04T00:26:28Z"},{"body":" <p>Alright.
