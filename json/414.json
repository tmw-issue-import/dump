{"issue":{"title":"[CF 414] Change the way the icon flash or/and add a feature ","body":" <p>Greetings!</p><p>I am runnung 4.7.3 version of TMW. I tried to set up icon flash, but I haven't found a way how to flash it not in color, but completely. Sorry, I not that good in english, so I have recorded 2 short movies to illustrate what I mean.</p><p>This one is how it set up now - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZRWbFHgtn8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZRWbFHgtn8</a><br>This one is how it should be set up - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zqckWS2_8k\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zqckWS2_8k</a></p><p>So,<br>1. It would be great if you can add a feature to make the icon flash in that way I have just showed.<br>2. Please add a checkbox for animation duration that will make animation work forever, not only a max of 10 secs.</p><p>TMW rocks! Thank you!</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/rokker9\">rokker9</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/414\">#414</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/414.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-01-08T07:37:03Z","created_at":"2012-01-07T22:40:19Z","updated_at":"2012-01-08T07:37:03Z","labels":["enhancement","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Added Icon: Alpha Flash to r404</p>\r\n<p>I will look into some sort of implementation for animations that don't expire.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-08T05:42:20Z"},{"body":" <p>Added the ability to play an animation indefinitely in r405.</p>\r\n<p>Let me know if anything is still left to be desired.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2012-01-08T07:35:10Z"}]}
