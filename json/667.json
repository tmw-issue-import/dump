{"issue":{"title":"[CF 667] Missing CC's from debuff categories ","body":" <p>I've noticed that Intimidating Roar (113056) that the druid receives from buffing a warrior with symbiosis is missing. Blinding Light (115750) from paladins is missing, some stun associated with Combustion (118271) is missing, the Disorienting Roar (99) from Druids is missing. I assume other CC gained from Symbiosis will also be missing.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/AmeroGer\">AmeroGer</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/667\">#667</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/667.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2012-10-24T23:39:44Z","created_at":"2012-10-22T11:03:03Z","updated_at":"2012-10-24T23:39:44Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Thanks.
