I've tried your TMW icon for spell power - it's very nice - thank you for it. A couple of things, your intial threshold is likely too low. Raid buffs will move it over that threshold as such it will stay on all the time. I've set mine to 30k. It works very nicely.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Iannet\">Iannet</a>","created_at":"2013-02-01T14:48:24Z"},{"body":" <p>I've kind of replaced this very icon by the AffDots addon, thus I haven't checked for a long time. The threshold was fine back in November. I had checked it without any raid buffs, just with procs raising my spell power above threshold. Great that it works for you though!</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/NirrAVEN\">NirrAVEN</a>","created_at":"2013-02-09T10:45:59Z"},{"body":" <p>Sorry for never getting to this ticket.
