{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1230] Request: Check last spell cast for ww monk mastery ","body":" <p>Thank you for working on this addon. I love it so much!<br><br>I was wondering if you have plans to add a condition to check last spell cast by player so that I can use tmw with my windwalker monk in Legion. The new ww mastery gives bonus dps so long as you don't use the same ability twice in a row. I'd love to be able to account for that in tmw.<br><br>Thanks for your time.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/heathmilo\">heathmilo</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1230\">#1230</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1230.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2016-07-18T19:29:19Z","created_at":"2016-07-18T19:28:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T19:29:19Z","labels":["enhancement","duplicate"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p><a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/TellMeWhen/issues?q=%5BCF%201226%5D+in%3Atitle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/tickets/1226-request-to-add-a-condition-to-check-last-spell-cast/</a></p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2016-07-18T19:29:10Z"}]}
