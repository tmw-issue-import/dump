{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1549] Unit Controls Vehicle Condition Not Working ","body":" <p>Just as the title says.</p>\r\n<p>I have a group condition for my TMW group to only show when it is false that the player unit is controlling a vehicle, or in other words, to hide it when I am controlling a vehicle.&nbsp; However, it's still showing when I'm in what counts as a vehicle, such as the Murky world quest.&nbsp; I also have \"Only show in combat\" checked for the group, in case that matters, but that's working correctly.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Kosouda\">Kosouda</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1549\">#1549</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1549.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-10-07T19:59:15Z","created_at":"2018-08-15T04:17:19Z","updated_at":"2018-10-07T19:59:15Z","labels":[]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Its working perfectly for me - just tested with the Murky world quest.</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-09-09T20:30:02Z"},{"body":" <p>I think I was an idiot here.&nbsp; I actually had two group conditions: \"Unit Controls Vehicle (player) False\" OR \"Action Bar Overridden False\"&nbsp; Apparently, that OR should be an AND.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I probably shouldn't even bother with that second condition.&nbsp; It's just that there are some odd quests, old ones, that override your action bar but don't use the vehicle UI, basically just Mind Control-type effects, so that's why I had it, and I honestly thought OR was correct.&nbsp; I'm not totally sure why OR is incorrect, but it must be that controlling a vehicle doesn't count as overriding your action bar because of the additional UI?&nbsp; Anyway, I'll just not use Action Bar Overridden and deal with it later if I ever actually need it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I honestly thought that second condition wasn't relevant to the problem, but I didn't do my due diligence in narrowing it down.&nbsp; Sorry, I know how typical this is. :P</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> <hr> <span class=\"e-infoLabel\">Edited</span><span> <abbr class=\"tip standard-date standard-datetime\" title=\"09 10 2018 17:53:44 (CST) (UTC-5:00)\" data-epoch=\"1536620024\">Sep 10, 2018</abbr></span> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Kosouda\">Kosouda</a>","created_at":"2018-09-10T22:52:30Z"}]}
