{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1426] Icon text label updated by Lua sciprt. Do-able? ","body":" <p>Hi there,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I was trying to assign my raid member through a split mechanism. I attached a piece of Lua script to an icon which monitors raid1-40 on that split debuff, and upon display of icon, my script could essentially work out the assignment I need and have each player with this tmw /s the result.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The problem is /s is pretty stacked with melees, so my initial plan is try updating the text label on this TMW icon by my script, so it could show the result to player instead. But I am a bit clueless - is that even do-able first?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any comment is much appreciated.</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Procyon\">Procyon</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1426\">#1426</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1426.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2017-08-06T04:21:36Z","created_at":"2017-07-13T09:58:53Z","updated_at":"2017-08-06T04:21:36Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>There might be a better way, but how I do stuff like this is use the [Stacks] dogtag and then use lua in a notification to set the stack text with something like icon:SetInfo(\"stack,stackText\",value,value)</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/canofbutter\">canofbutter</a>","created_at":"2017-07-14T14:37:08Z"},{"body":" <p>There are definitely more correct ways to do this, but they would require a whole lot more work than just doing what canofbutter suggested.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can set stack to whatever you want, stackText is all you really need for this (stack is used for things like min stacks/max stacks, while the text is strictly for display).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>icon:SetInfo(\"stack,stackText\", 0, \"text to show on the icon through the [Stacks] tag\")</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2017-08-06T04:21:36Z"}]}
