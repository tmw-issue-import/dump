{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1057] Unit Conditions (suggestion) ","body":" <p>1) Would be nice if you could make it so unit cooldowns reset their duration upon entering an arena game. It also so happens if you face the same team twice and you're using unit cooldowns to track their stuff, it'll retain the timer of their last used spell, even if it was last game.<br>2) Possibility to inherently exclude the player from being tracked as a unit cooldown subject? I just realized that if I make a Party1-4 unit cooldown tracking, say, a warrior's spell, it'll track my own stuff since I am a warrior who is in my own party. Adding a unit condition for != player seems to disallow the icon from showing entirely, even if I'm tracking another class's stuff (and I am not that class). Example:</p><p>^1^T^SShowTimer^B ^SUnit^Sparty~`1-4 ^SType^Sunitcooldown ^SName^SKidney~`Shot:~`20 ^SShowTimerTextnoOCC^B ^SUnAlpha^N0.5 ^SShowWhen^N3 ^SEnabled^B ^SUnitConditions^T ^N1^T ^SType^SCLASS2 ^SBitFlags^N8 ^SLevel^N1 ^t^Sn^N1 ^t^t^N72321^S~`~| ^Sicon^^</p><p>This only shows up if I don't have a 'unit isn't player' unit condition set. However, say if I was a rogue, and no other rogues were in the party, this would still show</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1057\">#1057</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1057.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2015-01-09T18:43:07Z","created_at":"2015-01-03T08:54:48Z","updated_at":"2015-01-09T18:43:07Z","labels":["enhancement","invalid"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Unit cooldowns should already do this.
