{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1621] \"Unit Condition Icon\" stopped working, \"Condition Icon\" works ","body":" <p>Formerly I had a setup of range indicators for the target, 40 yards, 30 yards, 8 yards, and so on, specific to the class/spec.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Each range icon was a \"Unit Condition Icon\". The range icons were fed to a meta icon.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since 8.5.5-1 (don't nail me on that, but I think it was 8.5.5-1) this doesn't work anymore.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For testing I disconnected a range icon from the meta icon, then it worked <em>sometimes</em>, but still far from reliably.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, I solved the problem now by converting all the \"Unit Condition Icon\" range icons to \"Condition Icon\" icons, that is, the range condition is now set in the icon's condition, and no longer in the \"Unit condition\" subcondition.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm reporting this because I'm not sure if this is an intended behavior change or rather a symptom of some underlaying bug.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If it is an intentional change, just close the ticket.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Portalbendarwinden\">Portalbendarwinden</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1621\">#1621</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1621.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-12-02T06:23:34Z","created_at":"2018-11-28T16:03:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-02T19:50:30Z","labels":["defect","resolved"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>Should be fixed now with&nbsp;<a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/files/2643292&amp;nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It was indeed recently broken with&nbsp;8.5.5-1.

A unit condition icon is used for cases when you want to know which units (from a large number of units) satisfy some conditions. For example, making an icon for each healer in the raid that is below 20% mana (You'd make the icon as a Group Controller).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you're only checking a single unit, then a regular Condition Icon will be better and simpler.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-12-02T19:50:30Z"}]}
