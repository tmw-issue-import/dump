{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1235] \"Last Ability Used\" detects different Spell IDs if they have the same name ","body":" <p>What steps will reproduce the problem?<br>If I set the condition Last Ability Used to detect Spell ID:26573 (Consecrate), it also triggers if it detects Spell ID:81297 (The Consecrate damage ticks that affect mobs).</p><p>This behaviour happens with all spells where the Spell triggered by a button push has the same name as the Spell that does damage to the mob. Another example is Blessed Hammer. The button push triggers Spell ID:204019 but the Spell that damages enemies is Spell:204301.</p><p>What do you expect to happen?<br>If I set Last Ability Used to detect Spell ID:26573 (Consecrate), it will NOT detect Spell ID:81297 (The Consecrate damage ticks that affect mobs)</p><p>What happens instead?<br>When I set Last Ability Used to detect Spell ID:26573 (Consecrate), it will DOES detect Spell ID:81297 (The Consecrate damage ticks that affect mobs)</p><p>What version of TellMeWhen are you using?
