{"issue":{"title":"[CF 1448] Super High Usage? ","body":" <p>v8.4.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm trying to figure out a reason why I'm getting random super high world MS spikes, and one of the things to do is reset UI. I imported all my TMW info and my usage was almost 100MB (<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7f6vikz.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://i.imgur.com/7f6vikz.jpg</a>). With all my normal addons on, it usually only hits 20-25MB.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I really don't know how much more info to put to this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Jalopyy\">Jalopyy</a> | Imported from CurseForge issue <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen/issues/1448\">#1448</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmw-issue-import/dump/blob/master/html/1448.html\">Raw</a>","closed":true,"closed_at":"2018-04-01T23:47:55Z","created_at":"2017-11-12T21:49:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T23:47:55Z","labels":["question"]},"comments":[{"body":" <p>What are you system specs that 100MB of memory is a concern?</p> <div class=\"project-issue-comment-body-modified\"> </div> \n<br>\n\n> Posted by CurseForge user <a href=\"https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Cybeloras\">Cybeloras</a>","created_at":"2018-01-20T21:41:39Z"}]}
